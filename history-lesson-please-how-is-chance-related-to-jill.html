They had a son, Phillip Chancellor II. Phillip Chancellor II married Nina Webster (Christine’s best friend), and they had a child Phillip Chancellor III, who goes by the name of Chance. As you can deduce, Chance is Jill Foster Chancellor Abbot’s grandson.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>thought Jill started out as her personal nail/hair girl then Catherine promoted her to companion as Phillip was hardly there and always fighting with Kay. Ester was always her maid. Jill eventually had an affair and fell for Phillip.</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><p>Yes, Katherine hired Jill as her personal assistant. And she sometimes did her hair and nails too. Kay had a different maid in the very beginning, but then Esther came along years later.</p><p>Back then Katherine was a chain smoking drunk, who slept with the stable boys. In the beginning, the then 18 year old Jill, was trying to help her. Phillip fell in love with her. They tried to fight their feelings for each other, but did end up giving into their feelings, and they had sex just one time, and she became pregnant. Jill was a virgin before that.</p><p>Phillip divorced Katherine, and Katherine was so angry she drove him off a cliff to his death. So Phillip married Jill on his death bed to provide for her and theri unborn son. But after his death Katherine had Phillip’s divorce from her invalidated, which invalidated Jill & Phillip’s marriage.</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p>Nina oh I miss those days</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Lily1</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>November 13, 2019, 4:12pm <span itemprop=position>12</span></span><p>Does anyone think we will see Nina and Ronan?

He has passed away, so she may want to do visits once again… at some point. She enjoyed coming back before her husband became ill.</p><p>Thank you Soushe so very much, as this sums it up beautifully…my problem was that I simply had forgotten that “Chance” is really the son of Phillip Chancellor II (the person that Cane actually impersonated when it was thought that PCIII had died)…AND that Chance is really PH3…thanks!</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>lomille</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>November 21, 2023, 12:10am <span itemprop=position>18</span></span><p>Thank you Soushe. I had forgotten how Chance became Jill’s grandson.</p><p>That is why I miss the “cast list” which used to be located right above these message boards. If I need to remind myself of certain things I would just look it up and refresh my memory. Does anyone know why the “cast list” has been eliminated? Or is it just not on my computer?</p><p>I don’t see the cast list anymore either. I think maybe it went away with one of the site’s redesigns.</p><p>SoapCentral has a great character history section. Although not all of it is up to date, their character profiles are detailed and interesting when you want an answer about a character.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmpp2jqK6osYybppqqlKh8tXvHoqqtp6Kueq2x0qymp2WgobKiv8Rmn6ivXZ7Abq%2FHmqWcnV2nsq2t056bZqyfYrequMtobmxwYmqA</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ichiro-suzukis-biography-fact-career-awards-net-worth-life-story.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ichiro Suzukis biography, fact, career, awards, net worth &amp;amp; life story</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./harry-morton-kingsman-tribute-explained-who-is-he-and-what-does-he-have-to-do-with-the-movies-231706-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Harry Morton Kingsman Tribute Explained, Who Is He and What Does He Have To Do With The Movies?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-awesome-easter-eggs-hidden-in-the-resident-evil-4-remake.html>12 awesome Easter Eggs hidden in the Resident Evil 4 Remake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./summer-tv-preview-2020-shows-to-watch-4073529.html>13 Reasons Why &amp;amp; More Shows To Watch Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aerodactyl-gl-rising-rivals-55.html>Aerodactyl GL (Rising Rivals 55)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-smith-net-worth-132013.html>Brooke Smith Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-is-fai-khadra-related-to-the-kardashians.html>How is fai Khadra related to the Kardashians?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
