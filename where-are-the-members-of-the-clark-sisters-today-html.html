The group was the first gospel act to cross musical charts and merge genres thanks to their vocal skill and innovative songs.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-2_60>They’ve gone on to become <a href=#>the highest-selling</a> female gospel group in history and inspired artists from all genres of music. The sisters branched out into their <a href=#>own successful solo careers</a> before reuniting in 2006. The film ended with a brief update on each individual member, with fans questioning whether or not they ever reconciled with one of their estranged sisters.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jacky-clark-chisholm><strong>Jacky Clark Chisholm</strong></h2><p id=par-3_60>Jacky is the eldest of the sisters and was the last to release a solo project with her 2005 debut album Expectancy.

She left The Clark Sisters in 1986 with rumors that she was kicked out. She later clarified that she left after becoming pregnant a fourth time and claims she was instructed to terminate the pregnancy.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" id=emb-8 readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bvxa_ISpl95/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p>Source: Instagram</figure><p id=par-16_13>She shared her story with talk show <a href=#>Larry Reid Live</a> in February 2019.</p><p id=par-17_48>“Nobody kicked me out.

I’m here to clear up the hearsay.”</p><p id=par-18_36>Denise did not have contact with her sisters until their mother died in 1994. The reunion was not pleasant, as depicted in the film with the other sisters feeling that Denise was disrespectful at the funeral.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" id=emb-9 readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BzOeYXYhB8Z/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p>Source: Instagram</figure><p id=par-19_52>Sadly, Denise remains estranged from her sisters today.
