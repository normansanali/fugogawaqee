She is well known for her over 50,000 Instagram followers and for posting pictures of herself modeling. However, her recent performance on Raising a F***ing Star is what has really given her the opportunity to reach the next level of stardom.</p><p style=text-align:left>Let’s take a closer look at her characteristics, including her age, height, parents, career, and more.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Meet Breanna Bunevacz, One Of The Cast Members Of Raising a F***ing Star</strong></h3><p>After Kris Jenner demonstrated that parents can fulfill their children’s dreams, producers began to explore how other parent managers, like Kris Jenner, are able to turn their kids into Hollywood stars.</p><p>Raising a F***ing Star made its debut on September 7, 2022, and assured viewers that four families with aspirational stars would go above and beyond to ensure that their child became the next generation’s entertainer. The Shen Family, Brooks Family, Benson/Dedman Family, and Bunevacz Family are all followed in the docuseries.</p><p>Of course, Breanna is a member of the latter.</p><p>She is the girl next door and a rising star, and her mother is helping her realize her Hollywood dream by advising and encouraging her.</p><p>When chances started to present themselves for Breanna, we will get to watch how her mother handles it on the show. When her lack of excitement and blasé attitude start to prevent her from achieving the dream they have always shared for her, she tries to guide her daughter on the correct route.</p><p>That same objective compels Breanna and her family to make big life changes. Fortunately, this family has discovered a way to work even harder for one another.</p><p>Additionally, Yolanda Hadid’s reality program Making the Model featured Breanna. She was captured on camera while working with Tommy Hilfiger. She was also credited in The Burning Dead (2015) and Blow’n Up (2015).</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>How Old Is Breanna Bunevacz?</strong></h3><p>In 2003, Breanna Bunevacz was conceived.

Breanna frequently thanks her on social media for everything she does for the family and for her.</p><p>The matriarch indicated being married and residing close to Los Angeles, California, on Facebook and TikTok <a href=#>@jessicarbunevacz</a>.</p><p>Jessica reportedly used to be a model and actress. She started working when she was 16 years old, but she eventually had to leave the Philippines and go to the United States in order to focus on being a full-time mother. She has been working to help Breanna have a lucrative and successful modeling career ever since she recognized her own life story in her daughter.</p><p>Breanna Bunevacz’s father, David Bunevacz, pleaded guilty to two federal offenses in July 2022 after defrauding investors of almost $28 million. After being detained in April, the former showbiz star and Filipino-American athlete was scheduled to enter a plea. He might spend up to 40 years in prison for defrauding American investors, according to them. Prior to this, the patriarch had previously garnered attention in Philippine entertainment due to his relationship with actress and former beauty queen Anjanette Abayari. He was still married to Jessica at the time that this information was released.</p><p>David became involved in a business scandal in the Philippines in December 2007 involving an upscale aesthetic clinic where he was president and his wife Jessica was in charge of marketing. He is accused of using corporate funds to buy a number of expensive vehicles, including a brand-new BMW X5 for his wife Jessica. These disputes involving David have continued.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>How Many Siblings Does Breanna Bunevacz Have?</strong></h3><p>Breanna has a big brother named Grant and an older sister named Hayca.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/breanna-bunevacz-age-parents-height-raising-a-fing-star-2022-300x195.jpg><p>You could follow Grant Bunevaccz on Instagram at @grant.bune and Hayca at @haycabunevacz.
