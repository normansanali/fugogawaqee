Given its outstanding ensemble, it is not surprising that the programme has a large following, with viewers constantly wanting to know more about the actors’ locations.

She is still wed to Huey Stanley, her third husband, as of the writing of this. The two were reportedly detained in West Virginia for conspiracy and fraudulent schemes in January 2023, though. The two’s bail was set at $13,000, and as per court documents, they were released on bond on January 19, 2023. In September 2022, the parents of 9 children observed their 19th wedding anniversary.</p><h3><span id=Where_is_Mellie_Stanley_Now>Where is Mellie Stanley Now?</span></h3>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Mellie Stanley Gypsy Sisters 💋 (@therealgypsymelliestanley)</a></p><p><br>Mellie Stanley, the self-described “black sheep” of the Stanley family, will now take centre stage. The reality TV personality has been involved in a number of court disputes over the years. She was detained in December 2017 for theft by deceit, illegal possession of a forged instrument, and unauthorised access to a computer in Lexington, Kentucky. Her ex-husband George Lee was also involved in this particular case. The two were charged with taking part in a $18,000 coupon scheme against Toys “R” Us and Babies “R” Us. Due to comparable allegations made against her in Tennessee, Mellie was detained in Indiana in March 2018. Even yet, three months later the accusations were dismissed.</p><p>Mellie was sentenced to probation and spared jail time after entering a guilty plea to theft by deceit and criminal possession of a counterfeit document in April 2019 in Fayette County, Kentucky. Since then, she appears to be thriving and has taken motherhood seriously. Serenity-Faye, her daughter, was born in March 2020. Together with the gorgeous girl, Richard Stanley, Brandy’Wyne Picolo, and Divinity Lee are also Mellie’s children.</p><h3><span id=Where_is_Joann_Wells_Now>Where is Joann Wells Now?</span></h3><p><br>Joann Wells does not appear to have run into legal issues again since her arrest in July 2014 for a Target scam involving roughly $14,700. The reality TV star’s legal issues were also discussed in the programme. Despite the fact that she had a warrant out for her arrest, she surrendered and later posted bail. Despite the fact that she does not appear to have been active on social media in recent years, we are confident that she is striving to live the best life she can.</p><h3><span id=Where_is_Sheila_Kayla_Williams_Now>Where is Sheila “Kayla” Williams Now?</span></h3>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Kayla Williams Gypsy Sister💋 (@gypsykaylawilliams_777)</a></p><p><br>Currently, Sheila “Kayla” Williams appears to be enjoying the best version of her life. The reality TV actress, together with her family, resides in Virginia Beach. She broke the news that her 1-year-old grandson had suffered second-degree burns in an <a href=#>accident</a> and needed to be hospitalised in September 2019. Naturally, her friends and family rallied behind her during such a trying time. At the moment, Kayla is quite active on social media, and she even has a Cameo account where fans may pay for a customised video, a business video, or a straightforward message. She also has over 155k Instagram followers and frequently collaborates with different brands for paid sponsorship.</p><h3><span id=Where_is_Angela_Annie_Malone_Now>Where is Angela “Annie” Malone Now?</span></h3>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Annie Gypsy Sisters (@gypsysisterannie)</a></p><p><br>In January 2017, Angela “Annie” Malone ran into legal issues after appearing on the TLC programme. She, Jeanette Small, and Dick Cooper were charged with overcharging their client by $6,000 using a given black cheque for garden labour they allegedly performed for an elderly person in Halifax County, North Carolina. Reports state that Mellie posted Annie’s bail, which was $400. As the mother of five stunning daughters, she has since carried on living her best life. She also has more than 69 000 Instagram followers, which undoubtedly helps with her ongoing prominence.</p><h3><span id=Where_is_Dovie_Carter_Now>Where is Dovie Carter Now?</span></h3><p dir=ltr lang=en>Tell me sweet beautiful Lies🙊 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/NM3a3O5w1R</a></p><p>— Dovie Carter (@GypsySisDovie) <a href=#>October 29, 2015</a></p><p><br>Dovie Carter, who appeared in season 4 of the TLC series, undoubtedly won the public’s respect for her efforts to promote harmony. Although though Nettie, Mellie, and Joann’s sister was a less important character on the show than some others, she nevertheless managed to win over viewers. She now seems to prefer to keep the specifics of her private life private, but we are confident that she will continue to lead a contented and happy existence.</p><h3><span id=Where_is_Laura_Johnston_Now>Where is Laura Johnston Now?<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/91-1.jpg alt="gypsy sisters destiny death,what happened to nukkie and pookie,where is mellie from gypsy sisters now,gypsy sisters instagram,danielle from gypsy sisters,nettie gypsy sisters instagram,gypsy sisters dallas,who is kayla from gypsy sisters married to,gypsy sisters cast,gypsy sisters where are they now,gypsy sisters where are they now 2022,where are the gypsy sisters,tlc gypsy sisters where are they now,gypsy sisters where are they now 2023,is gypsy sisters still on,is gypsy sisters coming back,where is the cast of gypsy sisters now" width=1200 height=725 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>The first season of the show featured a significant role for Laura Johnston, who is now known as Laura Stanley. Savannah, Hailey, and Bella Stanley are the couple’s three daughters. The reality TV personality regularly publishes lip-sync videos on <a href=#>TikTok</a>, some of which even include her kids. As of this writing, the family appears to be doing well, and Laura herself seems to <a href=#>be happy</a> with her life.</p><h3><span id=Where_is_Sheena_Small_Now>Where is Sheena Small Now?</span></h3><p>Sheena Small only appeared in season 2 of the show, but she had a significant impact while she was there. She and Nettie got into an online argument after the publication of the season 3 premiere episode, with the former using some foul language. Sheena had previously stated that she would not be continuing the show because the majority of the plot takes place in Tennessee, where she resides with her four daughters, Shakira, Shania, Shirley, and Frankie, whom she had with Henry, Mellie and Nettie’s brother.</p><h3><span id=Where_is_Dallas_Nichole_Williams_Now>Where is Dallas Nichole Williams Now?</span></h3><p><br>Dallas Nichole Williams currently resides in Atlantic City, New Jersey. In addition to running her own earring business, the reality TV star appears to enjoy being a mother to Demi, Richard, London, Aaron, Archie, and Huey. Dallas appears to be generally happy with her life, and we wish her nothing but the best for the future. She began dating James Malone in 2016, however it appeared to be short-lived.</p><h3><span id=Where_is_Nettie_Nuckie_Williams_Now>Where is Nettie “Nuckie” Williams Now?</span></h3><p>It appears that Nettie “Nuckie” Williams and Pookie are still dating. As of this writing, the two had three children together. Prince Henry, their first child, was born after their first wedding but before Netti left him. Afterwards, the two made amends and welcomed Ivory, their second child, in November 2017. 2019 saw the arrival of Delilah after that. We hope everything is going well for the family and send our warmest wishes.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/icon-256x256-1-150x150.png alt="gypsy sisters destiny death,what happened to nukkie and pookie,where is mellie from gypsy sisters now,gypsy sisters instagram,danielle from gypsy sisters,nettie gypsy sisters instagram,gypsy sisters dallas,who is kayla from gypsy sisters married to,gypsy sisters cast,gypsy sisters where are they now,gypsy sisters where are they now 2022,where are the gypsy sisters,tlc gypsy sisters where are they now,gypsy sisters where are they now 2023,is gypsy sisters still on,is gypsy sisters coming back,where is the cast of gypsy sisters now" itemprop=image sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Divesh Solanki</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Being a binge-watcher himself, finding Content to write about comes naturally to Divesh.
