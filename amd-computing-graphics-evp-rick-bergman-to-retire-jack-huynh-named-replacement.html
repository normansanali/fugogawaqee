Rick Bergman, the current executive vice president of AMD’s important Computing and Graphics business group, has announced that he will be taking up retirement later in the quarter. In his place, long-time AMD executive and design engineer Jack Huynh has been appointed as the new senior vice president and general manager for the group.</p><p>Rick Bergman is a well-known name at AMD with a significant history at the company, most notably on the GPU side of the business. Prior to <a href=#>re-joining AMD in 2019</a> to lead the Compute and Graphics business unit, he was CEO of Synaptics from 2011 through 2019. Before <a href=#>leaving AMD the first time</a>, Bergman worked at AMD (and earlier acquisition ATI) for over a decade, serving in various roles overseeing AMD’s GPU and CPU technologies, and helping to orchestrate AMD’s late 2000s graphics renaissance. This will mark the second (and final) time that Bergman is leaving the company, as he is retiring from AMD – though AMD notes that he will be sticking around through the current quarter “to ensure a smooth transition.”</p><p>In his place, long-time AMD executive (and design engineer) Jack Huynh has been tapped to lead the Computing and Graphics group. Huynh has been at AMD for over two decades, and prior to his new appointment, he was the senior vice president and general manager for AMD’s rather successful Semi-Custom business group for several years. With his new position, Huynh will have broad dominion over AMD’s desktop chip efforts, covering both CPUs and GPUs, including the ongoing development of AMD’s next generation of consumer and gaming products.</p><p>“Under Jack’s leadership, AMD has strengthened our position as the leading provider of custom solutions for gaming,” said Dr. Su. “We see strong long-term growth opportunities for our Computing and Graphics business as we bring our high-performance CPU and GPU IP together with our leadership software capabilities to create differentiated solutions across our foundational gaming franchise and a broader set of markets. As we welcome Jack in his expanded role, I also want to personally thank Rick for his many contributions and dedication to our business throughout his years with AMD.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH55hI9sZpqllGKwsLnPrquippditLOtz6GgnKtdmsOxedGimqRlkpq%2FqLnAp2Stp12nsrW10Z5ko5mToHqpwdinn2amkaKypXnRnqelmZOauqa60w%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./barbara-young-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-625163-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Barbara Young Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./william-pester.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>William Pester Was America's First Hippie In The 1910s</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-awesome-easter-eggs-hidden-in-the-resident-evil-4-remake.html>12 awesome Easter Eggs hidden in the Resident Evil 4 Remake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./summer-tv-preview-2020-shows-to-watch-4073529.html>13 Reasons Why &amp;amp; More Shows To Watch Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aerodactyl-gl-rising-rivals-55.html>Aerodactyl GL (Rising Rivals 55)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-smith-net-worth-132013.html>Brooke Smith Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-is-fai-khadra-related-to-the-kardashians.html>How is fai Khadra related to the Kardashians?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
