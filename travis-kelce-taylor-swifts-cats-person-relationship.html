However, it also seems obvious that many of <a href=# rel=nofollow>the songs that Swift has written</a> strike her biggest fans on an almost spiritual level.</p><p>Since Swift has a unique bond with her fans, she has <a href=# rel=nofollow>a slew of extremely popular songs</a>. Some of which are about her boyfriends, perhaps including <strong><a href=#>Travis Kelce</a></strong>. That artist-fan bond also causes Swift's fans to care about things like <a href=# rel=nofollow>how she got her teeth fixed</a> and about her cats. Swift's fans also recognize that <a href=# rel=nofollow>her relationship with Travis Kelce seems different</a>. For that reason, it isn't surprising that her love of cats seems to be affecting Travis Kelce.</p><h2 id=is-travis-kelce-a-cat-person-now-because-of-taylor-swift>Is Travis Kelce A Cat Person Now Because Of Taylor Swift?</h2><p>From the moment that fans became aware that something was going on with Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, there have been a lot of haters. There have even been some people who have suggested a conspiracy theory about Swift, Travis Kelce, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ttweb_why-travis-kelce-didn-t-want-his-dad-to-talk-to-taylor-swift_bk_a1.jpg><p>Despite all that, however, there have also been fans who've focused on celebrating how happy Swift and Travis Kelce seem together. Among those fans, there was a lot of excitement when there was a headline about Travis Kelce potentially becoming a cat person because of Swift.</p><p>How big is Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's age difference, according to Britannica?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">When was Taylor Swift born</a>?:</p></td><td><p>December 13, 1989</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Where was Taylor Swift born?:</p></td><td><p>West Reading, Pennsylvania</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">When was Travis Kelce born</a>?:</p></td><td><p>October 5, 1989</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Where was Travis Kelce born?:</p></td><td><p>Westlake, Ohio</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>How much older is Travis Kelce than Taylor Swift?</p></td><td><p>69 days</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unsurprisingly, Travis Kelce hasn't gone to the media to announce that he is a cat person. After all, that would be a weird thing for him to do. However, fans have come to believe that Travis Kelce is becoming a cat person because of something the tight end's sister-in-law said.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/have-taylor-swift-s-parents-secretly-profited-from-her-career_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Have Taylor Swift's Parents Secretly Profited From Her Career?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's parents are very private which has left fans wondering if they profit from her career.</span><p>In December 2023, Travis Kelce was interviewed for a podcast titled "New Heights". For anyone who isn't familiar with the "New Heights" podcast, it is hosted by Travis Kelce's brother and sister-in-law, Jason Kelce and Kylie Kelce.</p><p>As the trio's conversation continued, Kylie Kelce spoke about how she wanted to get a cat. Unfortunately for Kylie Kelce, however, her husband, Jason Kelce, was very clear that he didn't want them to get a family cat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not willing to give up on the idea, Kylie Kelce came up with the idea of getting Travis Kelce to help convince his brother to get a cat. As Kylie Kelce asked Travis Kelce for his assistance, she suggested <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">he might be a cat person now because of Taylor Swift</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/do-taylor-swift-s-cats-live-a-more-pampered-lifestyle-than-travis-kelce_-front-deposit-back-taylor-swift_ig.jpg><p>"No, here's the deal, I told Jason that I want to get a cat. And he told me no. And I feel like you might like cats now."</p><p>In response to Kylie Kelce's remark, Travis Kelce notably didn't deny he likes cats now because of Swift. Instead, Travis Kelce asked his sister-in-law what kind of cat she wanted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Evidently, Kylie Kelce thought that Travis Kelce had become such a big cat person that he might just get her one. As a result, Kylie Kelce made sure to tell Travis Kelce during the podcast interview that she didn't want him to get her a cat.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/taylor-swift-was-offended-by-joe-jonas-pregnancy-rumors-during-an-access-hollywood-interview-front-deposit-back-instar.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift Was Offended By The Joe Jonas Pregnancy Rumors During An Access Hollywood Interview</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift told an interviewer how upset she was about pregnancy rumors involving her ex-boyfriend Joe Jonas.</span><p>"I don't want you to send a cat. I just want you to get on my team here."</p><p>Of course, Kylie Kelce suggesting Travis Kelce might be a cat person now is pretty compelling. After all, Travis Kelce seems to be close to his family, so his sister-in-law's opinion about him carries a lot of weight.</p><p>If Kylie Kelce did get Travis Kelce to agree she should get a cat, he didn't seem to help her much. Months after Kylie Kelce tried to enlist Travis Kelce, Jason Kelce stated <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">he still didn't want to have an indoor cat</a> during a January 2024 episode of his podcast. However, Jason Kelce did seem open to getting a cat someday if it lives outdoors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That said, if anyone feels that Kylie Kelce's comments aren't enough proof, there is more than that. Days before the aforementioned podcast was released, The Mirror US published a report about Travis Kelce wanting <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Swift's cats to feel welcome in his home</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ttweb_why-fans-are-speculating-that-travis-kelce-and-taylor-swift-will-announce-they-re-having-a-baby_bk_a1_v4.jpg><p>According to The Mirror US' article which quoted Dexumoi's Meggie Kempner, Kelce wanted to add features to a home he was going to move into for Swift's cats.</p><p>"'Before Travis moved into his new house, he was looking at adding some features into it that incorporated an interest of Taylor's,' Dexumoi's Meggie Kempner teased during a new episode of the Deux U podcast."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Mirror US's article continued, "According to the gossip blog, Travis was trying to be considerate of Taylor's beloved cats.
