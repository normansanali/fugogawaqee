She was nonstop since the age of 21, and now, at 27, Solea’s preparing for her upcoming NYC solo show and return to the stage post-pandemic. Her solo show, along with her upcoming Tyler Petty film&nbsp;A Jazzman’s Blues, are reflective on the “reckoning and re-educating” of so many Americans in the last 18 months, she explained. “I don’t think there was any room for people sit and reckon with the pain and their privilege. There was a kind of re-educating that happened for those who were willing to open their eyes across the board over this past year. But having not had this stillness, had we not had this time to focus, it probably wouldn’t have happened,” Solea told H<strong>ollywoodLife.com</strong> in an EXCLUSIVE interview.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>She continued, “We look back and we think of these stories how things ‘used to happen,’ but it’s just history that has been repeating itself. We have these names, but there are countless names that came before. So, let us give faces to these names and humanize these names, so that people can feel in their heart and soul that something needs to happen.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/solea-pfeiffer-exclusive-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>The Black Lives Matter movement and ongoing reckoning have helped inform Solea’s one-woman show, You Are Here: An Evening with Solea Pfieffer, with Audible at the Minetta Lane Theatre. “My hope with this show, and what I was grappling with over this past year was actually a lot of thought about my own racial identity and my combination of privilege and point of view,” Solea, who is biracial, told HL. “We all had a bit of a reckoning with ourselves and this show is about wrestling with that and trying to figure out who you are, when you’ve been playing a lot of different roles and when you’ve been occupying spaces that were not always meant for you.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/solea-pfeiffer-exclusive-embed1.jpg alt width=620 height=481 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Solea continued, “I grew up not knowing where I fit, and I finally had time to really think about it when everything went quiet this year. So, this show is about my own journey of self discovery and figuring out who I am and where I fit into this world, in this industry. My main message with my show is if other people are feeling this way, they should know they’re not alone in that feeling.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Solea performs at Minetta Lane Theatre Thursday, November 4th – Saturday, November 6th and the show will be recorded and released to a global audience through Audible.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe5FyZqynnJqubrzFnqCfnpWnerXFy56pZqiVp7%2B6ecBmoZqyqqKur7%2BMm6OunaNk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./august-alsina-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Is August Alsina's Current Net Worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./blackberry-playbook-review.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>QNX: The PlayBook OS - The BlackBerry PlayBook Review</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-awesome-easter-eggs-hidden-in-the-resident-evil-4-remake.html>12 awesome Easter Eggs hidden in the Resident Evil 4 Remake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./summer-tv-preview-2020-shows-to-watch-4073529.html>13 Reasons Why &amp;amp; More Shows To Watch Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aerodactyl-gl-rising-rivals-55.html>Aerodactyl GL (Rising Rivals 55)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-smith-net-worth-132013.html>Brooke Smith Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-is-fai-khadra-related-to-the-kardashians.html>How is fai Khadra related to the Kardashians?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
