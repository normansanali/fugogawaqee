However, in reality, it is nothing but added pressure in the case of Cheyenne <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Woods</a>, who chose to follow in her uncle’s footsteps. Yet, the LPGA Tour player has always tried hard to prove her worth in the professional golfing world, and in August 2022, she earned one of the most prestigious honors a golfer can have in their career.</span></p><p><span>Not just once, but many times, Cheyenne has proved herself with her skills. The LPGA pro has been dedicated to golf since childhood. Although she gets only a few opportunities to meet the GOAT of golf, the 32-year-old pro-golfer tries to get more input on her game from him. As a matter of fact, Cheyenne has once revealed <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Earl Woods, Tiger’s father, played an essential role in her career</a>. And finally, her dedication and passion landed her a great honor.</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><span>A new milestone in the career of Cheyenne Woods</span></h2><p><span>Cheyenne Woods, a Wake Forest alumnus from 2012, will soon be enshrined in the <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Wake Forest University Hall of Fame</a>. Notably, the news was released months after Tiger Woods was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame. The official Twitter handle of Wake Forest Demon Deacons made the official announcement last year. In her honor, they said, “Leaving a legendary mark on @WakeWGolf, including a dominating seven-shot victory at the 2011 ACC Championship, @Cheyenne_Woods is our latest inductee into the Wake Forest Sports Hall of Fame!”</span></p><p><span>She earned a communications degree from Wake Forest in 2012. And the 2-time pro champion competed in 38 tournaments for the Old Gold and Black before turning pro in 2012. Cheyenne was named All-American twice and earned All-ACC honors in three of her four college years. Later, she went on to play on the Epson, LPGA, and the Ladies European Tours.</span></p><p><span>After turning professional in 2012, Cheyenne qualified for the 2012 U.S. Women’s Open. She finished as a co-medalist at her qualifier and made her professional debut in the same year at the LPGA Championship. Her official induction date will be announced later.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Watch This Story: <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Tiger Woods’ Niece Cheyenne Woods Once Took a Fearless Stand to Change the Game</a></strong></p><p><span>Getting such a great honor from the institution you studied from is truly an honor.
