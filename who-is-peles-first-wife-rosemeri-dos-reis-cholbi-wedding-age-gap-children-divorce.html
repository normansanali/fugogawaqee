His birthday is October 23, 1940. On the field, he played as a forward. Since he is regarded as one of the all-time greatest players, FIFA has given him the moniker “The Great.” He was regarded as one of the most popular and successful athletes of the 20th century.</p><p>In 1999, he was named one of Time magazine’s 100 most influential individuals of the 20th century as well as the International Olympic Committee’s Athlete of the Century. Pele and another player shared the FIFA Player of the Century award in 2000.</p><p>Pelé, then a teenager, joined a youth squad coached by Waldemar de Brito, a former member of the Brazilian national soccer team. De Brito convinced Pelé’s parents to let him leave home at the age of 15 so he could try out for the Santos professional soccer team.</p><p>The NASL was not yet a well-known league in 1974 when Pelé announced his retirement from soccer. Pelé was convinced to come back the next season to play for the New York Cosmos, though. In an exhibition match between New York and Santos in October 1977, he participated for both clubs in his final game. Throughout 1,363 appearances, he scored 1,281 goals to round off his career.</p><p class=toc_title>Table of Content</p><h2><span id=Who_is_Pele8217s_first_wife_Rosemeri_dos_Reis_Cholbi>Who is Pelé’s first wife Rosemeri dos Reis Cholbi?</span></h2><p>Rosemeri dos Reis Cholbi was born in 1942.
