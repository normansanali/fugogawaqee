All of them have the same character traits conspicuously in common.</p><p>They are obnoxious, conditioned low-roaders who once would have been rejected for their antisocial, desensitized public conduct.</p><p>They are all unabashedly vulgar.</p><p>They are all rude, rotten winners.</p><p>They have been antithetical to the minimal ideals of their sports and all sports.</p><p>And they are a turn-off to those who know what ails us, the nation and kids born and raised to excessively ugly scenes and words that so clearly afflict their social growth to maturity.</p><p>Yet look at the rewards they have reaped for acting like creeps.</p><p>President Biden bestowed on Rapinoe the country’s highest civilian medal, apparently for behaving like a preening, stage-hogging, me-first, bully who brought dishonor to America throughout and beyond an internationally televised World Cup.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Randy Arozarena celebrates his home run against the Yankees on May 5. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>How do we fix this?</p><p>It’s too late.</p><p>The assigned authorities of the sports — adult men and women — are either compliant or eager to have the sport removed from their sports rather than risk ridicule as being out of step.</p><p>That’s why “End Racism” Roger Goodell invites vulgar, N-word-spewing, crotch-grabbing rappers to “entertain” at the Super Bowl.</p><p>On May 5, Rays star Randy Arozarena hit a home run against the Yankees.</p><p>As he approached third base, he stopped and posed, arms-folded like a smug braggart — a stance mimicked by third base coach Brady Williams.</p><p>Then he did it again on the way to the dugout, in unison with teammate Wander Franco.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Randy Arozarena celebrates a home run against the Yankees. <span class=credit>USA TODAY Sports via Reuters Con</span></figure><p>Hitting a home run — or even a double — no longer speaks for itself.</p><p>It must be followed by some excessively immodest demonstration that is rationalized and excused by pandering modern media as professionals merely “having fun” — even if violence naturally follows.</p><p>In fact, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred has certified such conduct as a great way to attract our children to baseball.</p><p>The MLB Network regularly presents home-plate posers and bat-flippers as the cool guys of The Game.</p><p>Naturally, as if Manfred doesn’t know better — and he may not — Arozarena became a target, twice hit by pitches.</p><p>A brawl was naturally anticipated, but was unplugged by umps quickly acting as cops.</p><p>I guess that those who didn’t see the fun in it at all were not genuine fans of what baseball and nearly all sports have become.</p><p>Two days later, during a Denver-Phoenix playoff game — these NBA playoffs have been infested with selfish, personal, all-about-me incivilities — Suns team owner Mat Ishbia<a href=#> became involved in a sideline shoving incident </a>with Denver star Nikola Jokic.</p><p>But this season, from Dallas to New York, we’ve seen that dignity is not required to own an NBA team.</p><p>We can run, but short of surrendering sports to those who are destroying them, we can’t hide.</p><p>Not even if we return to the black hills we ain’t never seen.</p><p>So where do we go when nothing is beneath us?</p><p>For some — as in many — we go away, never to return.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Huggins keeps job after slur, but guy who blasts him on air does not</h2><p>World Gone Nuts, continued:</p><p>Josh Neighbors, the host of the “Locked on Big 12” podcast since 2020, felt that West Virginia basketball coach Bob Huggins’ recent radio appearance, in which Huggins mocked “Catholic f–s,” was reprehensible.</p><p>To prove his point, he played Huggins’ words, no editing, as the coach had spoken them on a Cincinnati radio station:</p><p>Neighbors: “I made the conscious decision to play Huggins’ comments in their entirety and without censoring the slurs he used. I did that because I thought it was important to get the full context of what he had said.”</p><p>“I followed that up by saying I thought what he said was abhorrent. I thought it was hateful and also that if I was the AD, I would have fired him, as I would not want somebody who espouses those views coaching my team.”</p><p>Neighbors was then fired for promoting hate speech.</p><p>Move along, nothing more to see here, just another victim of those illogically frightened by fringe lunatics.</p><p>Reader Robert Valenti on MLB’s new shift rules, which have reduced shifts by, at most, only a few feet:</p><p>“I am convinced that if a team pulled all its fielders except the pitcher and catcher, the opposing batters would still swing for the fences.”</p><p>Last week, the Mariners played three at the Rangers.</p><p>In a total of 26¹/₂ innings, in which 24 pitchers entered to record 159 outs, 71 of them — 45 percent — were strikeouts.</p><p>That’s Suzyn, baseball!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>It’s not O-Kay, Michael</h2><p>Not sure why Michael Kay, other than due to insecurities, continues to engage in public spats with anonymous callers and text typists, thus consistently revealing himself as excessively defensive — and thus a loser — every time.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Michael Kay <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>Meanwhile, his ESPN Radio and YES simulcasted three-stooges show has deteriorated into the “Defend Michael Kay Sycophant Session.”</p><p>NBC still doesn’t seem to get it during Triple Crown coverage.</p><p>Even last week, with a late scratch of the favorite sending Kentucky Derby odds into flux, NBC only occasionally posted each horse’s odds.</p><p>Why not maintain them on a steady scroll?</p><p>Or did NBC again think that those with a wager didn’t amount to many?</p><p>The New York Times was bashed last week for doing what ESPN does nearly every day — taking credit for others’ work.</p><p>In this case, The Times credited itself for a scoop first reported by a small Long Island newspaper, the North Shore Leader, that exposed Congressman George Santos as an autobiographical fantasist, aka a liar.</p><p>I know the feeling.</p><p>In 1992, I busted my fanny to locate, retrieve and reveal transcripts from a lawsuit deposition in Cincinnati during which Reds owner Marge Schott was proven to be a hardcore racist. In that instance, The Times was a week behind.</p><p>But to this day, it is given — and accepts — full credit for breaking that story, one that led to Schott’s suspension from MLB.</p><p>Sorry for the self-indulgence, but it still ticks me off.</p><p>Well, good as they were all regular season, that should teach the Devils not to play a Stanley Cup series without a goaltender.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j25mamtfp666v4yrmKecqWKus7vZmqmeppFit7C1zaxkoKqfrLavs4yloKysXaSzbr%2FTmp6eZZiktKi1zaBkmqyYobK1sdJmm6KroprAsbHCraCnn12crq6xjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./roger-ludvigsen.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Roger Ludvigsen</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./peter-roussel-cause-of-death-age-wife-children-press-secretarys-net-worth-funeral.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Peter Roussel cause of death, age, wife, children, Press Secretary's net worth, funeral</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-awesome-easter-eggs-hidden-in-the-resident-evil-4-remake.html>12 awesome Easter Eggs hidden in the Resident Evil 4 Remake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./summer-tv-preview-2020-shows-to-watch-4073529.html>13 Reasons Why &amp;amp; More Shows To Watch Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aerodactyl-gl-rising-rivals-55.html>Aerodactyl GL (Rising Rivals 55)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-smith-net-worth-132013.html>Brooke Smith Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-is-fai-khadra-related-to-the-kardashians.html>How is fai Khadra related to the Kardashians?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
