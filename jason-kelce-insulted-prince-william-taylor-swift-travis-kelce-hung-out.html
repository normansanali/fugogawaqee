He shares his kids with Kate Middleton (they also have a younger son, George, 6), <a href=#>who’s currently undergoing treatment for cancer</a>. But it seems like William was determined to give his kids a sense of normalcy during the fun-filled evening at Taylor’s concert.</p><p>The following day, Taylor shared the photo on Instagram, writing, "Happy Bday M8! London shows are off to a splendid start.”</p><p>The official Instagram account of Prince William and Kate Middleton also posted the selfie, captioning it with, “Thank you @taylorswift for a great evening! #LondonTSTheErastour.”</p><h2 id=jason-kelce-made-harsh-comments-about-the-royals>Jason Kelce Made Harsh Comments About The Royals</h2><span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Travis and Taylor may have seemed happy to hang with the royals, fans were quick to point out Jason Kelce's recent comments about the monarchy, suggesting he may not have been beaming like his younger brother if he had gotten the chance to take a selfie with England’s future king.</p><p>Just last week, Jason expressed his disdain for monarchies during a previously recorded discussion about Father’s Day traditions in Thailand on the June 19 episode of their podcast, New Heights.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/the-eras-tour-taylor-swift-s-most-memorable-off-script-moments-so-far-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The Eras Tour: Taylor Swift’s Most Memorable Off-Script Moments (So Far)">The Eras Tour: Taylor Swift’s Most Memorable Off-Script Moments (So Far)</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's 'Eras Tour' has been memorable for many reasons, but not everything has gone according to plan...</p><p>"I’m out on honoring kings,” Jason declared. “Listen, we’re Americans. We don’t do royalty.” He added emphatically, “F–k kings. But I wouldn’t mind [wife] Kylie [Kelce] kneeling at my feet.”</p><p>Travis seemed to realize he would soon meet Prince William, leading him to make a surprised face. He gestured for Jason to stop. "Not f–k kings," Travis corrected him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an effort to steer the conversation in a different direction, Travis then asked his brother a question. “Why are you into people kneeling at your feet?” Jason responded, “It’s out of respect, it’s Father’s Day. Maybe feed me some grapes.”</p><p>Travis pointed out the inconsistency in Jason's statements, saying, “You can’t be ‘out on kings’ and ‘in on people bowing.’” Jason clarified, “I’m not into people bowing. I’m into my children bowing to me to show me respect, God dammit.”</p><p>Following Travis’s meeting with Prince William, fans and listeners of New Heights couldn't help but comment on the amusing timing of the podcast episode, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Us Weekly notes</a>.
