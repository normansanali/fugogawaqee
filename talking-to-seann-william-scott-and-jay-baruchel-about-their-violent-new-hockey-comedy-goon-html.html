Baruchel also wrote the movie with Seth Rogen’s writing partner Evan Goldberg. The PR team promoting Goon set up a string of conference rooms at the hotel for Scott and Baruchel to drop by and record TV and radio spots, plus participate in a roundtable interview with about 15 web and print journalists, including myself.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t66bk0i4e8e84ntnlls5w@published data-word-count=70>I sat down at the round table that we’d be using for the roundtable interview, along with a slew of movie journalists, many of whom have been writing for major newspapers for decades and probably resented some plucky kid working for a blog that’s been around for a year and a half. It was like a clash between New Media and Old Media. A really, really boring, low-key, almost-nonexistent clash.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t66bk0i4f8e84if5j15x6@published data-word-count=128>When Seann William Scott and Jay Baruchel made a charming entrance and sat down for their joint roundtable interview, all the journos and myself slid our near-identical recording devices across the table towards the movie stars, and the interview began. How these roundtable interviews work is that whichever journalist starts talking first gets to ask their question. It’s often pretty competitive, and everyone’s kind of waiting for the interviewee to wrap up their answer so that they can get their question in during the split second of silence after the actor stops talking and before the inevitable rapid-fire question from somebody else. Occasionally, two journalists will start speaking at the same time until one of them backs down and the other one continues with his or her question.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t66bk0i4g8e84yqkzgvx2@published data-word-count=107>It’s a pretty aggressive environment for something as trivial as chatting with actors about their new movie, and sadly, in the below interview, I was unable to get a single question in. In my defense, there were multiple other writers who also couldn’t get a word in edgewise. I tried. I really tried for you guys. I had questions prepared. Good, solid questions that could have taken the interview to fascinating, unimaginable places. Oh, what could have been. If I was just willing to cut people off or shout over them. I started to speak a couple times but lost out to more confident and experienced journalists.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t66bk0i4h8e84zr54q8c0@published data-word-count=40>Enjoy this conversation that I was present for but didn’t participate in!

He was an immigrant to Canada, and I can’t separate my understanding of hockey and hockey fighting specifically from my dad and this first generation Jewish immigrant experience.&nbsp; ‘Cause he played hockey in an all Jewish hockey team. He finished his checks, man. He was there to look out for his boys.&nbsp; He was part of the pendulum shift generation of Jews where his last generation wanted to hide your Jewishness, Anglicize your name.&nbsp; Dad couldn’t find a Magen David fucking big enough.

And, then to go one further, to write a hockey movie, you can never disconnect from Slap Shot. That being said, it’s a nightmare to try to recreate something. And, it’s also just untruthful. So, we always knew in the best case scenario this would end up being to our generation what that was to that one. But, we had no interest in making the next one.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t66bk0i5a8e84xo2lbar8@published data-word-count=109>But it was a reaction to how shitty hockey’s been photographed since then, in movies anyway. Not on television, not on broadcasts.&nbsp; The lack of space, the speed that the boys are going at, the size of the boys themselves, how small the puck is for whatever combination of reasons hockey’s been photographed terribly in movies.&nbsp;It’s always been too precious, too staid, too slow, too fucking stagy and fake.&nbsp;And that was like one of these things. We had our list of things that we needed to nail and if we didn’t nail we should just pack up and go home ‘cause there’s no point to make this bloody movie.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t66bk0i5b8e847nd5q8r0@published data-word-count=93>And those things were we needed the hockey to be the best that it’s ever been in a movie.&nbsp;We needed our fights to be as strong as fuck just hockey fights, any fight. We wanted to go toe to toe with any… movie fight in the past 20 years it wanted it to be truthful.&nbsp; And we just wanted it to be as exhilarating, as horrifying, as awe-inspiring, as beautiful… This combination of things. Hockey’s nothing if not a confluence of phenomenon and emotions, and we just tried our best to show that.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t66bk0i5c8e84nmc2725b@published data-word-count=36><strong>See Seann William Scott and Jay Baruchel in the hockey movie Goon, which opens in select theaters today and is also available On Demand if you don’t feel like doing that whole “leaving the house” thing.</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t66bk0i5d8e84u1yg99ul@published data-word-count=0></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t66bk0i5e8e84gb1g8hq2@published data-word-count=27><a href=#>Bradford Evans</a> will try to be more assertive and forceful with his questions the next time he gets to interview the stars of a new hockey comedy.</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Talking to Seann William Scott and Jay Baruchel About […]</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWloa2dgaHy1rcukoKefXam8br%2FEmqWnZaeeua21wKZkrJufqcFurc2dZKOZqWKvor7UnJ%2BepF2Wr7DB02aroZ2Zp3q3tc6lnKesXaOyuHnHqJqknalisLC5xJ2wZp%2BfpLtvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./samsung-fascinate-review-verizons-galaxy-s-smartphone.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>TouchWiz and Verizon's Preloads - Samsung Fascinate Review: Verizon's Galaxy S Smartphone</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sophie-turner-period-calorie-counting-interview.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sophie Turner Says Calorie Counting &amp;amp; Extreme Dieting Stopped Her Period for a Year</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-awesome-easter-eggs-hidden-in-the-resident-evil-4-remake.html>12 awesome Easter Eggs hidden in the Resident Evil 4 Remake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./summer-tv-preview-2020-shows-to-watch-4073529.html>13 Reasons Why &amp;amp; More Shows To Watch Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aerodactyl-gl-rising-rivals-55.html>Aerodactyl GL (Rising Rivals 55)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-smith-net-worth-132013.html>Brooke Smith Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-is-fai-khadra-related-to-the-kardashians.html>How is fai Khadra related to the Kardashians?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
