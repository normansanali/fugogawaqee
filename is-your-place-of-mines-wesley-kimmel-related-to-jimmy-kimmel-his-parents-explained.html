While fans are intrigued to see their favorite stars on screen, there is one name that has caught popular attention. That is, <strong>Wesley Kimmel</strong> – who will be playing Jack, the adolescent son of his overprotective mother, Debbie. The name has led many to believe that he might be related to talk show host <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jimmy Kimmel</a> in some way.</p><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=680 data-injectable=true>Well, it turns out that they are right. Wesley Kimmel is the nephew of the talk show host. Born on April 25, 2008 in California, Wesley is the son of director and producer Jonathan Kimmel and writer and producer Carly Hirsch Kimmel. Let’s get to know a little more about the Kimmel family. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-who-are-wesley-kimmel-s-parents data-injectable=false><strong>Who are Wesley Kimmel’s parents?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Jimmy-and-Jonathan-Kimmel.png><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=594 data-injectable=true>While Wesley Kimmel is all set to appear alongside two of the A-list actors in Your Place or Mine, this is not the 15-year-old child actor’s debut in the film industry. His entry into the world of entertainment was as ‘Baby Bachelor’ which was aired for six episodes on Jimmy Kimmel Live.</p><p data-characters=222 data-current-count=222 data-injectable=false>Earlier, he appeared as an extra in WandaVision where he could be spotted in a TV commercial. His other works include the series Good Girls and The Book of Boba Fett before he landed the role of Jack in Your Place or Mine.</p><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=527 data-injectable=true>Both of his parents are involved in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">entertainment industry</a>. His father is the younger brother of Jimmy Kimmel, making him the paternal nephew of the talk show host. Jonathan started his career as a post-production assistant as well as a voice actor in the animated sitcom South Park from 1998 to 2008.</p><p data-characters=463 data-current-count=463 data-injectable=true>He began in 1998 as the series’ post-production assistant. Later, he went on to work as a staff writer for the show and wrote for the first six seasons of the series which went on to win three Emmy Awards. Besides this, he was also the voice actor in a couple of episodes such as “Best Friends Forever,” “The Losing Edge,” and “Night of Living Homeless,” to name a few. Jonathan also directed around 498 episodes of Jimmy Kimmel Live From 2012-2018.</p><p data-characters=540 data-current-count=540 data-injectable=true>In 2017, he collaborated with his brother to create a series with their take on nepotism. They created The Nepotist, a multi-camera comedy series from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Meadow Lark Lane production in association with 20th Century Fox TV</a>. The series centers around Tim Primo, who’s exhausted with keeping his family members employed, so he hires the smart, talented, and hard-working Josh Dixon to supervise them. Jimmy was the show’s Executive Producer and Jonathan was the writer. This will probably be remembered as the siblings’ most memorable work.</p><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=208 data-injectable=false>His wife and Wesley’s mother, Carly Hirsch Kimmel is a producer, writer, and a lecturer. Not much information can be gleaned about her probably due to her wish to remain low profile about her personal life.</p><p data-characters=111 data-current-count=319 data-injectable=false>While everyone is excited to see Wesley Kimmel on screen, there’s hope to see more of him in future projects.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S2tHnYqKyrZaChrqSxjKidZqWZo7K0edaeqqWdqWK4qrnMnqNmqpWhrrWxw2arqGWanrquxYykoKallaF6qbXSZqeaqpWjwbR5xLGnpZmZo7Klew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jalyn-armour-davis-journey-to-greatness.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jalyn Armour-Davis: Journey To Greatness</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./intel-raptor-lake-ddr5-benchmark.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Intel Raptor Lake finally makes DDR5 memory worth it</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-awesome-easter-eggs-hidden-in-the-resident-evil-4-remake.html>12 awesome Easter Eggs hidden in the Resident Evil 4 Remake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./summer-tv-preview-2020-shows-to-watch-4073529.html>13 Reasons Why &amp;amp; More Shows To Watch Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aerodactyl-gl-rising-rivals-55.html>Aerodactyl GL (Rising Rivals 55)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-smith-net-worth-132013.html>Brooke Smith Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-is-fai-khadra-related-to-the-kardashians.html>How is fai Khadra related to the Kardashians?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
