Ever since she emerged on the music scene in 2005 following a historic <a href=#>American Idol</a> win, she has become one of country's biggest stars and gone on to release chart-topping hit after hit.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>During Carrie's performance at the 2022 Country Music Awards in Nashville, some fans took notice of something being slightly off regarding her appearance. With that being said, what is going on with Carrie Underwood's lips? Here's what we know about the situation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fans noticed something off with Carrie Underwood's lips during the 2022 CMAs.</h2><p>When the 2022 CMAs aired on Nov. 9, 2022, Carrie was one of the artists tapped to perform. During her time on stage, users began taking to social media to discuss her appearance, namely, her lips.</p><p>"Carrie, please quit doing stuff to your face. Your [sic] a beautiful woman. I hadn’t seen you in a while and was watching CMA and your lips are — well, I don’t think it’s what you had hoped. Not being mean, just concerned," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> one fan.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I love Carrie Underwood but if she had more stuff in her lips she would have floated into the air," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">added</a> another fan.</p><p>"Carrie Underwood got new lips. Why?" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chimed in</a> a third.</p><p>So, did Carrie actually get new lips? Well, yes, but it's a bit complicated.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Carrie Underwood was in a freak accident in 2018 that injured her lips.</h2><p>Although the 2022 CMAs are the most recent instance of people noticing something up with Carrie's looks, it is not the first time the topic has been brought up. Carrie broke down the reasoning for her appearance changing a bit in a note to her fan club members, via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People.</a> She explained that a freak fall outside her home caused some harrowing injuries.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"In addition to breaking my wrist, I somehow managed to injure my face as well. I’ll spare you the gruesome details, but when I came out of surgery the night of my fall, the doctor told [Underwood’s husband] Mike that he had put between 40 and 50 stitches in," the singer wrote. Her injuries were so severe that she had to miss her performance at that year's Country Rising show in Nashville as it fell just weeks after when she was hurt.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Carrie has clapped back at rumors that the accident was a plastic surgery coverup.</h2><p>In a 2018 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Redbook Magazine</a>, Carrie spoke out against those who said that her accident story was fake and a coverup intended to mask elective plastic surgery procedures.</p><p>"I’m on some magazine every other week for something crazy. It’s a little sad because the truth is just as interesting. I wish I’d gotten some awesome plastic surgery to make this [scar] look better," she stated at the time.</p><p>If one thing is clear, it's that Carrie's injuries have certainly not slowed her career momentum one bit. Her recent album "Denim & Rhinestones" has been lauded by critics and fans alike since its June 10, 2022 release, and appearance comments aside, fans seemed to really love Carrie's performance at the 2022 CMAs as well.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmK6zvsieZK6mlJq%2FuLvOnWSloaCo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./all-the-main-characters-in-the-black-butler-anime-series.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>All the main characters in the Black Butler anime series</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./toy-story-3.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Toy Story 3 (Movie) Cast</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-awesome-easter-eggs-hidden-in-the-resident-evil-4-remake.html>12 awesome Easter Eggs hidden in the Resident Evil 4 Remake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./summer-tv-preview-2020-shows-to-watch-4073529.html>13 Reasons Why &amp;amp; More Shows To Watch Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aerodactyl-gl-rising-rivals-55.html>Aerodactyl GL (Rising Rivals 55)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-smith-net-worth-132013.html>Brooke Smith Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-is-fai-khadra-related-to-the-kardashians.html>How is fai Khadra related to the Kardashians?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
