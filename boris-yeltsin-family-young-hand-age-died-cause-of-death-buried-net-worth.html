In 1991 he became the first popularly elected leader in the country’s history, guiding Russia through a stormy decade of political and economic retrenching until his resignation on the eve of 2000.</p><p>He was born on February 1, 1931, in Sverdlovsk [now Yekaterinburg], Russia, U.S.S.R. and died on April 23, 2007, in Moscow, Russia). Yeltsin was perceived at varying times as a folk hero, as a symbol of Russia’s struggle to establish a democracy, and as a dictatorial figure (an all-powerful ruler).</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=boris-yeltsin-family></span>Boris Yeltsin Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Boris Nikolaevich Yeltsin was born into a Russian working-class family on February 1, 1931, in the small Siberian village of Butko. His parents were Nikolai and Klavdia Yeltsin. He grew up with a younger brother, Mikhail, and a younger sister, Valya.</p><p>The Yeltsin family lived in communal, or group, situations, first on a farm and later at a construction site where his father worked. His family was in close contact with many other families and their privacy was extremely limited.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=boris-yeltsin-young></span>Boris Yeltsin Young<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>His early life, like most of his countrymen in the 1930s and 1940s, was marked by hardship, and as the oldest child Boris had numerous responsibilities at home.</p><p>A strong-willed child, Boris twice stood up to the educational system. At his elementary school graduation he criticized his homeroom teacher’s abusive behavior, which resulted in him being kicked out of school.</p><p>He appealed the decision and, after an investigation, the teacher was dismissed. During his last year in high school Yeltsin was stricken with typhoid fever, a terrible disease that causes fever and other symptoms and is easily spread, and forced to study at home.</p><p>Denied the right to take final examinations because he had not attended school, he appealed and won. His actions were extraordinary considering this happened during the rule of Joseph Stalin (1879–1953), a period when the government had an intense stronghold on its citizens.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=boris-yeltsin-hand></span>Boris Yeltsin, Hand<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Yeltsin lost two fingers from his left hand as an 11-year-old after he stole two hand grenades from a storehouse and attempted to smash one open with a hammer.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=boris-yeltsin-age-died></span>Boris Yeltsin Age Died<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>76 years old</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=boris-yeltsin-cause-of-death></span>Boris Yeltsin Cause Of Death<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>He died of cardiac arrest on 23 April 2007, twelve days after being admitted to the Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=boris-yeltsin-buried></span>Boris Yeltsin Buried<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>He was buried in Novodevichy Cemetery which is a cemetery in Moscow.
