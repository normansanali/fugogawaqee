Of course, now that superhero movies have been reigning supreme at the box office for many years, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that people line up to see DC movies. Sadly, however, The Suicide Squad is the only all-new DC Films project that will be released in 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following The Suicide Squad’s release, the movie became one of the most talked-about things in the entertainment business. For example, a lot of people were overjoyed to talk about <a href=#>the secret Marvel cameo that appears in The Suicide Squad</a>. On top of that, lots of fans of the film were excited to discuss The Suicide Squad’s star-studded cast. Considering how many rich and famous actors starred in The Suicide Squad, that begs an obvious question, how do they compare to each other in terms of net worth?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Which Suicide Squad Member Has Died The Most In The Comics?</a></span></p><h2 id=daniela-melchior-ndash-net-worth-about-700k><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Daniela Melchior – Net Worth: About $700k</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Prior to the release of The Suicide Squad, Daniela Melchior definitely was the movie’s least famous star, at least that is the case in North America. However, that doesn’t mean that Melchior hadn’t enjoyed a lot of success as an actor by that point. After all, Melchior starred in 203 episodes of the Portuguese telenovela Valor da Vida and she voiced Spider-Gwen for the Portuguese version of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. As a result of those credits and the salary she was paid for The Suicide Squad, <a href=#>Melchior is worth roughly $700k</a> according to celebnetworths.com.</p><h2 id=david-dastmalchian-ndash-net-worth-about-1-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>David Dastmalchian – Net Worth: About $1 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout David Dastmalchian’s career, he has proven to be an extremely talented actor. Despite that, Dastmalchian has always been a character actor who is memorable for his roles in films like the Ant-Man series, The Dark Knight, Bird Box, and Blade Runner 2049 among others. Given that the world has now seen how great Dastmalchian was in his starring The Suicide Squad role, there is no telling where his career will go from here. That said, Dastmalchian has a low position in this list because he only has a $1 million net worth according to celebnetworths.com.</p><h2 id=joel-kinnaman-ndash-net-worth-14-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Joel Kinnaman – Net Worth: $14 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ever since Joel Kinnaman first rose to prominence following the debut of AMC’s The Killing, the talented actor has remained extremely busy in Hollywood. Able to break out even further after taking on a pivotal role in House of Cards’ fourth and fifth seasons, Kinnaman also became a legitimate movie star with the release of 2016’s Suicide Squad. As one of the few stars from the original film who also starred in the sequel, The Suicide Squad, Kinnaman has played a key role in connecting the two movies. Given all of the success Kinnaman has enjoyed, it makes sense that he is worth $14 Million according to celebnetworth.com.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Close Did Tom Hardy Come To Starring In ‘Suicide Squad’?</a></span></p><h2 id=viola-davis-ndash-net-worth-25-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Viola Davis – Net Worth: 25 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it comes to the cast of The Suicide Squad, it could easily be argued that Viola Davis is the film’s most talented actor even though the film’s other stars are pretty great as well. For proof of that fact, all you have to do is look at the fact that Davis has won an Oscar, an Emmy, and a Tony. Additionally, Davis may just be the only actor in Hollywood with enough gravitas to believably bring Amanda Waller to life in the Suicide Squad films. With all of that in mind, it is disappointing that Davis is on the bottom side of this list but she has an extremely healthy $25 million net worth according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><h2 id=margot-robbie-ndash-net-worth-26-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Margot Robbie – Net Worth: 26 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When 2013’s The Wolf of Wall Street was set to be released, everyone expected to be talking about the movie's director Martin Scorsese and its main star Leonardo DiCaprio once it began screening. Instead, there was one actor that became the talk of the town once the world saw the film, Margot Robbie. Similarly, following the release of 2016’s Suicide Squad, most people considered Robbie’s performance as Harley Quinn to be the film’s highlight. Due to her attention-grabbing performances, Robbie has starred in many major films which has allowed her to amass an impressive $26 million net worth according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Impressive Margot Robbie Scene From 'Suicide Squad' Was Not CGI</a></span></p><h2 id=idris-elba-ndash-net-worth-30-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Idris Elba – Net Worth: 30 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In Hollywood, there are a handful of actors that are so popular with their peers and audiences that everyone wants them involved in their project. For proof of the fact that Idris Elba is one of those actors, all you have to do is look at the actor’s amazing filmography which proves that he has worked with many of the biggest movie stars in the world. On top of that, Elba has become a big enough star to headline tentpole films like The Suicide Squad. With all of that in mind, it almost is surprising that is only worth $30 million according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><h2 id=john-cena-ndash-net-worth-60-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>John Cena – Net Worth: 60 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the last several years, John Cena has become one of the most in-demand actors in Hollywood due to his roles in movies like Trainwreck, Blockers, Bumblebee, F9, and The Suicide Squad. Given the position that Cena now holds in Hollywood, he can now demand huge paycheques for his acting work. Despite that, it is clear that the main reason why he is so high on this list is that <a href=#>Cena spent many years as the WWE’s highest-paid and biggest star</a>. As a result of both highly successful phases of his career, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cena is worth $60 million</a> according to celebritynetworth.com</p><h2 id=sylvester-stallone-ndash-net-worth-400-million><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Sylvester Stallone – Net Worth: 400 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout Hollywood history, it has been proven that action movies have the potential to make a fortune at the box office. With that in mind, it makes all the sense in the world that Sylvester Stallone is the wealthiest person who starred in The Suicide Squad. After all, Stallone has starred in some of the biggest action movies of all time including the Rambo, Rocky, and The Expendable film series, as well as Cliffhanger and Demolition Man. As a result of those credits, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stallone is worth $400 million</a> according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Twitter Can't Decide Which Member Of 'The Suicide Squad' Is The Best</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqMKqr8idnGaroaqupXnCmqqtZaKWu6yxw2akmqqXpMFuvs6bmaKdXZ6xs7XSZpylmpFit7C0zWaanqaRYrumwIywpqusmGQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ann-street-new-york-parking-garage-57-video-in-lower-manhattan.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ann Street New York Parking Garage 57 Video In Lower Manhattan The Talks Today</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-zendayas-sexuality.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Is Zendaya's Sexuality?
