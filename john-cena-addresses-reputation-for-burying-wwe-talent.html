Cena has accomplished a lot in his 20 years with the company and remains a massive name in the industry. The Doctor of Thuganmotics also decided to address his reputation for burying talent after WrestleMania 39.</p><p><a href=#>John Cena kicked off WrestleMania Saturday</a>&nbsp;back in April as he challenged Austin Theory for the United States Championship. It was a serviceable match for many, which saw Theory defeat Cena after a low blow and his finisher.</p><p>That said, John Cena has a reputation for burying talent and there are numerous examples to prove this view. This includes the time he buried The Nexus back in 2010, among others.</p><p>While speaking with&nbsp;<a href=#>Busted Open Radio</a>, The Leader of Cenation addressed his reputation for burying talent and stated that he didn’t want to ‘pass the torch’ to just anybody. Cena then used his match against Autin Theory at WrestleMania 39 to further prove his point.</p><p>“You don’t pass it to anybody. You just hope to put energy out there and anyone with potential can get it. It was said that I passed the torch to Roman years ago, and he absolutely is the face of the franchise.</p><p>In my mind, he’s the greatest of all time. I tried to do what I could, and when I did it, it wasn’t the miracle. Like, it didn’t happen. He got it on his own terms.</p><p>I just like seeing people who are passionate about the business, who want to be there, who want to show up, who aren’t using it as a vehicle to do something else because the thing itself is awesome. It’s okay if you get other opportunities outside. That’s a testament to your work, but man, I wish I was still there every day.</p><p>So with me, if you put me in that conversation, I could only help the person that I was working with while I was working with him. The reputation I had in the sauce while I was in it was that I buried talent because I would really invest my wholeheartedness.</p><p>I sat with Austin Theory for like 10 hours. Not wasted a day, invested a day, to talk about our why, like, what’s our story going to be? I would do that with everyone. I live it. My heart is on the plate. But after they were with me, they didn’t take that energy with them, but I gave it to the next guy.</p><p>So okay, who’s next? It was AJ and now it’s Kevin Owens. Alright, ‘Kevin, come here. We’re gonna sit down for two weeks and just talk about stuff. Then we’re gonna go out there and try some crazy stuff, see what works, and then put our best foot forward.’ Kevin’s done, Sami, no problem.</p><p>What Roman does, just being affiliated with his energy, he gets so many people over. That’s something I could never do, ever, period.</p><p>Like, you’re with me and you got a chance when you’re there, but a lot of times you went off to do stuff that wasn’t looked at in the same way, and then the perception of the audience is, ‘Oh my god, he buried him.’ Winning and losing doesn’t matter. I haven’t won a match in five years. It doesn’t matter.”</p><p>John Cena is currently busy with his life in Hollywood, as he will be starting in ‘Fast X’ as well as Greta Gerwig’s highly anticipated film ‘Barbie,’&nbsp;<a href=#>where he will be portraying the role of mermaid</a>. Cena’s legacy will forever be remembered and that is all that matters to him right now.</p><p>What’s your view on what John Cena said? Do you agree with him?
