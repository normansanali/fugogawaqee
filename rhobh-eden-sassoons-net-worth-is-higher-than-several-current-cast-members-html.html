Worth about <a href=#>$20 million</a>, Sassoon has family money, but also earnings she cultivated on her own. She owned and operated her own salon, <a href=#>EDEN by Eden Sassoon</a>. Plus she owned a Pilates studio. Vidal Sassoon had a net worth of <a href=#>$200 million</a>. The visionary stylist died in 2012.</p><p id=par-3_28>Beverly Hills is one of the richest series in the Housewives franchise and Sassoon has a net worth that is much higher than quite a few cast members.</p><h2>Sassoon’s net worth exceeds all of the actors on the series</h2><p id=par-4_72>At $20 million, Sassoon has a higher net worth than former friend Lisa Rinna. Sassoon was introduced on the show through Rinna but left with few relationships on tact. Kim Richards was on the series at the time and as a sober woman, Sassoon felt the need to help. Rinna told Sassoon that Richards was close to death due to her alcoholism. And that her sister Kyle Richards was an enabler.</p><p id=par-5_46>Rinna’s net worth currently holds at about <a href=#>$10 million</a>. Also, she’s higher than actress and friend Eileen Davidson who is at <a href=#>$3 million</a>. Actress and newcomer Garcelle Beauvais is at $8 million. Meanwhile, Denise Richards is the highest-paid actor in the bunch at <a href=#>$12 million</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-6_47>Former model and actress Brandi Glanville has a net worth of <a href=#>$5 million</a> and was reportedly earning $175,000 per season of the show. Although Erika Jayne (Girardi) has a reported net worth of <a href=#>$5 million</a>, her husband, famed attorney Tom Girardi is worth <a href=#>$30 million</a>.</p><h2>Which cast members’ net worth exceeds Sassoon?</h2><p id=par-7_26>Sassoon’s net worth almost sits in the middle of the cast because there are several RHOBH cast members who have a significantly higher net worth.</p><p id=par-8_67>Camille Grammer is worth <a href=#>$50 million</a> and so is <a href=#>Adrienne Maloof</a>. Former cast member Yolanda Hadid has a net worth of <a href=#>$45 million</a>. At one point, Lisa Vanderpump had the highest net worth in the series. Vanderpump is at a reported <a href=#>$90 million</a>, but her assets are combined with husband Ken Todd. She was also paid the highest amount for the series at $500,000 per season.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-9_46>Vanderpump left RHOBH but still had her series Vanderpump Rules on Bravo. However, that contract appears to be in limbo as four cast members were fired for racist actions. Additional cast members are being investigated and production has not made a call about another season.</p><p id=par-10_57>Kyle Richards now appears to be the richest at <a href=#>$100 million</a>. She is reportedly paid $270 per season and has been on the series since it’s inception. Richards was previously noted as being worth $50 million. However, both she and husband Mauricio Umansky&nbsp;are now cited as being at $100 million, which could represent their combined assets.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS%2FqbvBoWSenJWjerSt0qymqKajYrumwIywpqusmGK2tHnHop6hnaJiwamtzWaqnq6Vp66tecKuqaudnql6pK3SrWSmnZ2XsrO%2FjaGrpqRf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./flying-pings.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Flying Pings Fresher Post</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dennis-maher-obituary-old-bridge-nj-in-loving-memory-of-dennis-maher-death.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dennis Maher Obituary Old Bridge NJ, In Loving Memory Of Dennis Maher Death</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-awesome-easter-eggs-hidden-in-the-resident-evil-4-remake.html>12 awesome Easter Eggs hidden in the Resident Evil 4 Remake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./summer-tv-preview-2020-shows-to-watch-4073529.html>13 Reasons Why &amp;amp; More Shows To Watch Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aerodactyl-gl-rising-rivals-55.html>Aerodactyl GL (Rising Rivals 55)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-smith-net-worth-132013.html>Brooke Smith Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-is-fai-khadra-related-to-the-kardashians.html>How is fai Khadra related to the Kardashians?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
