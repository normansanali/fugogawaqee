My boy who told me about it was like, ‘Man I used to love that show, I think you should do it!’ And he was actually the determining factor for me … I went to go look at some of the old seasons and I flipped through a couple of episodes and I was like, ‘Okay, this could be cool!'”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>The premise of the show is to place eight celebrities from different walks of life under one roof together.
