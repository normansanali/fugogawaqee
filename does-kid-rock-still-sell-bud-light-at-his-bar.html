However, the artist and restaurant owner may not have been as angry as people initially thought.</p><p>Budweiser was called out by many, including Kid Rock, after the brand partnered with Dylan to celebrate her "<a href=#>365 days of Girlhood milestone</a>," with people even believing the partnership was an April Fools Day prank. Kid Rock and others protested the partnership, and Budweiser's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">operating profit in the U.S. dropped nearly 30 percent</a>.</p><p>Now that the controversy has seemingly died down, the rock singer may have put aside his feelings about the popular beer brand. So, does that mean it's still available at his Nashville restaurant Kid Rock’s Big A** Honky Tonk & Rock ‘n’ Roll Steakhouse?</p><p>Here's what we know.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, does Kid Rock still sell Bud Light at his bar?

Let me say something to all you at B as clear and concise as possible," he said before blasting away two full cases of Bud Light on his property.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=zxx dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/dSmCGySoul</a></p>— KidRock (@KidRock) <a href=#>April 4, 2023</a></figure><p>But, not only did he appear to be having a fun one August night with his Bud Light while watching a Colt Ford show, his friends also seemed to be enjoying the refreshments on the restaurant sky deck. Although it is unclear why he had a change of heart so quickly, perhaps not even Kid Rock can stay mad at the brand forever.</p><p>Meanwhile, Dylan may not have moved on from the controversy, especially since she claimed on a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok video</a> that the brand never reached out to her following the brutal backlash.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Yes, Kid Rock still sells Bud Light at his bar.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kid Rock (@kidrock)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@kidrock</a><p>Kid Rock with four friends in Nashville - including Theo Von, Marcus King, and Zac Brown</p></figure><p>Kid Rock's latest opinions toward the beer brand are unknown, but as of now, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his restaurant menu</a> shows that Bud Light is still one of the many domestic beers available for customers to purchase.</p><p>His Nashville hotspot not only sells Budweiser, but Busch Light as well, which is a brand under the <a href=#>Anheuser-Busch</a> Companies.</p><p>Coincidentally, Kid Rock also called out the parent company at the end of his viral video after shooting up the Bud Light beer cases.</p><p>At time of writing, the company's beer sales had still not yet recovered from the controversy involving Dylan, yes, despite the fact that Kid Rock is still sipping the brew, and it has not been banished from the menu at his bar.</p><p>And, the rocker has not yet spoken out about his bark with no bite when it comes to actually hating on Bud Light.
