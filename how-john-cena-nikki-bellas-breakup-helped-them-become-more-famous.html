Suddenly, people who only read supermarket tabloids cared about John Cena and Nikki Bella and this data shows it.<br>The blue line is John Cena and the red line is Nikki Bella. They didn’t let us pick the colors, but that kind of works. Check out that spike at the same time where Nikki rose to above where Cena had been climbing toward with Cena spiking even more. Then as they taper off, John evens out to about where he was and since he’s in huge movies now that will likely keep going up and level off at higher search results because he’ll be an even bigger movie star. But Nikki’s traffic seemed to level off and remain higher than she already was. Even after it dropped&nbsp;slightly, later on, it was still higher than it was before.<br><a href=# rel=attachment></a><br>&nbsp;<br>Yes, for fun we added Brie Bella to the list as well. She’s that yellow line that looks like the kind of heartbeat you should worry&nbsp;about.<br><a href=# rel=attachment></a></p><p>October 19, 2018 12:57 pm</p><span class=author-name>H Jenkins</span> <span></span><p>I love pro wrestling and hate BS.
