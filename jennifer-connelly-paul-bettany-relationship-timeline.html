And then, of course, there’s the involvement of national treasure <a href=# class=T3D>Jennifer Connelly.</a> In the film, she plays Penny, the love interest to <a href=# class=T3D>Tom Cruise’s Maverick</a> — but what about in real life? As it turns out, she’s married to <a href=# class=T3D>fellow actor Paul Bettany,</a> and has been for quite a while.</p><p>Connelly and Bettany’s relationship timeline officially began in the early aughts, when they married after working together on <a href=# class=T3D>A Beautiful Mind</a> — but in a Hollywood fairytale sort of way, their pairing seemed fated from even earlier on. Ahead, the details on a serendipitous childhood crush and every other entry on their power couple love story.</p><h2>1980s: A Teenage Crush</h2><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>As Bettany told Larry King in 2015,</a> he was crushing on Connelly from afar when they were both teenagers, citing her performances in Once Upon a Time in America (“Not a bad first film,” he said) and <a href=# class=T3D>Labyrinth,</a> where she starred alongside <a href=# class=T3D>David Bowie.</a> But he was a kid in London, and she was a budding movie star in America — so, for a while, his crush was just that: a crush.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Georges De Keerle/Hulton Archive/Getty Images</p></figure><h2>2000: They Work Together (But They’re Dating Other People)</h2><p>Connelly and Bettany connected IRL while working on the 2001 film, <a href=# class=T3D>A Beautiful Mind.</a> But a relationship was not in the cards just yet. “We liked each other, but we didn't do anything about it,” <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>she later told Glamour.</a> “We were both in relationships. We didn't get together until months and months after that film.”</p><h2>2001: 9/11 & A Proposal</h2><p>Eventually, Connelly explained, their respective relationships ended. “When I saw Paul again and we were both single, we got together really quickly,” she said. But that may be an understatement — at least, as Bettany remembers it. <a href=# class=T3D>The WandaVision star</a> also revealed on Larry King that he proposed to Connelly without ever really dating her. He was abroad during <a href=# class=T3D>9/11,</a> and spent two days trying to get in touch with his co-star (long after filming had wrapped). “I remember, very clearly, thinking to myself, ‘What are you doing?’ Oh... I realized I was in love. So I got her on the phone, and said I’m coming over, and let’s get married.”</p><p>Connelly — who had one child, Kai, from a previous relationship — told Glamour what made the decision a no-brainer. “It was something about the way that we were together,” she said. “He stood out to me as someone singular and rare and beautiful, and I liked the way he was in the world. I liked the way he was with people. I liked the way he was with my son and the way he made me feel.”</p><h2>2003: They Get Married</h2><figure class="Qf5 nbP" readability=2><p>Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic/Getty Images</p></figure><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>As they confirmed to People in early 2003,</a> Connelly and Bettany got married in Scotland over the winter holidays. “Marriage and children changed my life,” Bettany told the same magazine <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>18 years later.</a> “It really altered who I was and what I saw as my goals.”</p><h2>2003 & 2011: They Welcome 2 Children</h2><p>In addition to raising Kai together, Connelly and Bettany’s family grew with the birth of son Stellan in 2003, and daughter Agnes in 2011.</p><p>Unlike Bettany’s <a href=# class=T3D>WandaVision kids,</a> these ones seem to be very real! As he told People last year, he treasures the moments “when I catch myself and realize the five of us are laughing together,” adding that “there is nobody on earth with whom I could be having a better time.”</p><h2>2017: A “Meta” Marvel Connection</h2><p>Connelly and Bettany’s first collaboration may have been most pivotal to their relationship, but they’ve actually teamed up together since — in a true <a href=# class=T3D>Avengers</a> sense. Bettany famously plays Vision in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but he also voiced Jarvis, the AI component of <a href=# class=T3D>Tony Stark’s Iron Man suit,</a> before appearing as a physical character in <a href=# class=T3D>Avengers: Age of Ultron.</a></p><p>When it came time to program a similar AI voice for Peter Parker’s Spidey suit in <a href=# class=T3D>Spider-Man: Homecoming,</a> MCU boss Kevin Feige cast Connelly in the role of Karen. “One, she's a great actress, can do anything she wants,” <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Feige explained to Slashfilm in 2017.</a> “Two, she inhabits some of the classic ’80s films that helped to inspire us behind the scenes. And three and most meta, she's married to Jarvis.”</p><p>So even though Connelly and Bettany haven’t technically appeared together in the MCU, this adorable Easter egg is just one more example of their Hollywood fairytale.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZqOdnqO2p7HRZpqopp6aua3FjKmYrqRdl7K1wMCnsGaqlaGutbXOp6qhoaBiwaq5xKWgp50%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jo-o-f-lix.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Joo Flix</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./janet-leigh-husband-janet-leigh-married-to.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Janet Leigh Husband: Who was Janet Leigh married to?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-awesome-easter-eggs-hidden-in-the-resident-evil-4-remake.html>12 awesome Easter Eggs hidden in the Resident Evil 4 Remake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./summer-tv-preview-2020-shows-to-watch-4073529.html>13 Reasons Why &amp;amp; More Shows To Watch Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aerodactyl-gl-rising-rivals-55.html>Aerodactyl GL (Rising Rivals 55)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-smith-net-worth-132013.html>Brooke Smith Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-is-fai-khadra-related-to-the-kardashians.html>How is fai Khadra related to the Kardashians?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
