With only one season left, Max’s fate is not exactly known, and even <a href=#>Sink has been vocal</a> on this state of limbo that her character is in.</p><p>Either way, the actress can look back on her time on Stranger Things with pride, although it has not always been smooth sailing. At one point, she was put in an awkward situation by creators Matt and Ross Duffer, an episode that <a href=#>enraged the public against the brothers</a>.</p><p>Sink has managed to come through unscathed, however, and continues to build on an impressive career. As well as <a href=#>playing Max on Stranger Things</a>, here are some of her other most memorable roles so far, including a famous character on Broadway.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is Sadie Sink Absolutely Sick Of Hearing Kate Bush's "Running Up That Hill"?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=annie-annie><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Annie (Annie)</span></h2><p>Sadie Sink has been acting since she was 11 and honed her craft on stage before she made her foray into screen work. One of her very early roles was the titular character in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">popular Broadway musical play, Annie</a>.</p><p>She first played the character in a regional production, before making her Broadway debut at the Palace Theatre in 2012.</p><h2 id=maxine-39-max-39-mayfield-stranger-things><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Maxine 'Max' Mayfield (Stranger Things)</span></h2><p>It would be remiss to talk about Sadie Sink’s most memorable roles and fail to mention the biggest of her career so far. She joined <a href=#>the cast of Stranger Things</a> as Max at the beginning of Season 2 and has featured as a regular ever since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Together with her colleagues on the show, Sink has earned two SAG Award nominations for “Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series.”</p><h2 id=suzanne-ballard-american-odyssey><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Suzanne Ballard (American Odyssey)</span></h2><p>Although Max is Sadie Sink’s standout television role so far, she has been a main cast member on a TV show before. In 2015, she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">appeared in 11 out of 13 episodes of American Odyssey</a>, an action series that aired on NBC.</p><p>Sink portrayed a character known as Suzanne Ballard.

One of her most notable roles in the movies is Ziggy Berman, in the last two installments of the teen slasher film trilogy, Fear Street.</p><p>In both movies, Sink plays a character called Ziggy Berman. The role saw her nominated for an MTV Movie & TV Award this year.</p><h2 id=young-queen-elizabeth-ii-the-audience><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Young Queen Elizabeth II (The Audience)</span></h2><p>Sadie Sink’s last Broadway role was a huge one, as she starred alongside Helen Mirren in a stage production titled The Audience. With the legendary actress playing reigning Queen Elizabeth II, Sink had the distinct honor of stepping into the shoes of a younger version of the monarch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mirren would later win a Tony for her work in the play.</p><h2 id=haley-eli><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Haley (Eli)</span></h2><p>Sadie Sink played cameo roles in the movies Chuck and The Glass Castle to kick off her big screen career in 2016 and 2017 respectively. Two years later, she had an even more meaningful part in a film, when she landed a central, supporting role in Ciarán Foy’s horror film, Eli.</p><p>Sink was cast in the part of a character called Haley.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth Is Reportedly Friends With These Celebrities</a></span></p><h2 id=tween-girl-unbreakable-kimmy-schmidt><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Tween Girl (Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt)</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though barely out of her teenage years, Sadie Sink has already proven her versatility. Fewer roles could back this argument up better than her cameo as a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tween girl on the Netflix sitcom, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt</a>.</p><p>Sink only appeared in one episode, titled Kimmy Sees a Sunset.</p><h2 id=susan-waverly-white-christmas><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Susan Waverly (White Christmas)</span></h2><p>Susan Waverly in a 2011 production of the musical play White Christmas was officially Sadie Sink’s first ever professional acting role. Although <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the production was not universally well received</a>, it opened the door to other gigs on stage for Sink and arguably, to all other roles that she has taken on since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As well as episodes of The Americans and Blue Blood, she also featured in a <a href=#>short film titled All Too Well</a>, which was written and directed by musician <strong><a href=#>Taylor Swift</a></strong> in 2021.</p><h2 id=sadie-sink-rsquo-s-upcoming-roles><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Sadie Sink’s Upcoming Roles</span></h2><p>Although there is a chance that she might not return to <a href=#>Season 5 of Stranger Things</a>, Sadie Sink’s career is guaranteed to keep on growing.
