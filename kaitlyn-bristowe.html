Her mother was a ballerina, a skill that Kaitlyn inherited when she got a dance scholarship and then became a spin-class instructor.</p><p>Bristowe was a contestant on The Bachelor, vying for <a href=#><strong>Chris Soules</strong></a>‘ eye in 2015. But it was the audience who she managed to win over with her sense of humor and relatability. She ended up in third place that season, losing to runner-up <a href=#><strong>Becca Tilley</strong></a> and winner <a href=#><strong>Whitney Bischoff</strong></a>.</p><p>She then returned to Bachelor Nation as one of two Bachelorettes, alongside season 19 contestant <a href=#><strong>Britt Nilsson</strong></a>. It was put to the vote on the first night which of the two women would get to stay, and Bristowe won the majority vote of the male contestants. During her season, she made the shocking choice to allow season 10 contestant <a href=#><strong>Nick Viall</strong></a> join the competition for her heart. Bristowe went on to choose <a href=#><strong>shawn booth</strong></a>, who proposed to her in the season finale. They were together for three years before calling off their engagement and ending their relationship in November 2018.</p><p>In March 2021, it was confirmed that Bristowe will cohost season 17 of The Bachelorette alongside former Bachelorette <a href=#><strong>Tayshia Adams</strong></a>.</p><p>Since her time in the franchise, Bristowe has appeared on Dancing With the Stars, where she was partnered with professional dancer <a href=#><strong>Artem Chigvintsev</strong></a>. The duo ended up winning the 29th season in November 2020.</p><p>Bristowe has also ventured into creating her own podcast, “Off the Vine With Kaitlyn Bristowe,” which began in May 2017, and hosted the Broadway show Home for the Holidays&nbsp;in late 2017. Bristowe now has a line of wine called Spade and Sparrows, and she debuted her single, “If I’m Being Honest,” in May 2020.</p><p>In between all of this, Bristowe has also found time to find love with former The Bachelorette contestant <a href=#><strong>Jason Tartick</strong></a>. They started dating in January 2019 and later moved in together in Nashville with their two golden retrievers. They announced their engagement in May 2021. They confirmed their split in August 2023.</p><span>More ▾</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOinKxnm5a2tbjYp2SbqpmowbDDxGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kat-dennings-returning-wandavision.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kat Dennings And Randall Park Returning For WandaVision</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jessie-ware-htm.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jessie Ware - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-awesome-easter-eggs-hidden-in-the-resident-evil-4-remake.html>12 awesome Easter Eggs hidden in the Resident Evil 4 Remake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./summer-tv-preview-2020-shows-to-watch-4073529.html>13 Reasons Why &amp;amp; More Shows To Watch Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aerodactyl-gl-rising-rivals-55.html>Aerodactyl GL (Rising Rivals 55)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-smith-net-worth-132013.html>Brooke Smith Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-is-fai-khadra-related-to-the-kardashians.html>How is fai Khadra related to the Kardashians?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
