Peacock, meanwhile, offers the entire series. For the week of June 29, Suits racked up more than 3 billion minutes of viewing on the two platforms, marking a Nielsen streaming chart record for an acquired title.</p><p>The numbers are certainly impressive, but Nora and Lilla say they haven’t seen much of an increase in their residual payments. “It’s really hard to sort through all these checks, because you get dozens of them that are, like, $7 here, $30 there and so forth,” Lilla explained. “But that’s with Suits airing on two different major streaming platforms. It’s this blockbuster hit, and I received a grand total of $414 for it.”</p><p>Nora, for her part, added, “You hope that maybe some magical check will arrive, but it does not appear. … It’s been pretty sad.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Suits-Writers-Slam-Netflix-for-Pretty-Sad-Residual-Checks-as-Show-Surges-in-Popularity-inline.jpg><p>Low residual payments are <a href=#>one of the main reasons</a> why two Hollywood unions — <a href=#>the Writers Guild of America</a> and the Screen Actors Guild – American Federation of Television and Radio Artists — <a href=#>are in a standoff</a> with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. Before streaming became a primary means of watching TV, actors and behind-the-camera crew relied on residual payments to hold them over between projects. Those payments have dwindled during the streaming era, so WGA and <a href=#>SAG-AFTRA strikers</a> are hoping to renegotiate a better contract with AMPTP.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Zuckermans are just two of many in the entertainment industry <a href=#>who have spoken out</a> about their miniscule residual payments. Last month, <a href=#><strong>Mandy Moore</strong></a> revealed that she’s received “very tiny, like, 81-cent checks” for <a href=#>This Is Us</a>, which was a major hit when it originally aired on NBC.</p><p>“The residual issue is a huge issue,” Moore, 39, <a href=#>told The Hollywood Reporter</a> while <a href=#>joining a SAG-AFTRA picket line</a> in Los Angeles. “We’re in incredibly fortunate positions as working actors having been on shows that found tremendous success in one way or another … but many actors in our position for years before us were able to live off of residuals or at least pay their bills.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKquoaSoeri%2ByK2cq6tdqLmiuYynnK2enJ7FbrLOq2SpqpWpwbp50pqbZqqVqLalwcClZJyglZi4tHs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tej-lalvani-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-645994-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tej Lalvani Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./steve-perry.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Steve Perry Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-awesome-easter-eggs-hidden-in-the-resident-evil-4-remake.html>12 awesome Easter Eggs hidden in the Resident Evil 4 Remake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./summer-tv-preview-2020-shows-to-watch-4073529.html>13 Reasons Why &amp;amp; More Shows To Watch Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aerodactyl-gl-rising-rivals-55.html>Aerodactyl GL (Rising Rivals 55)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-smith-net-worth-132013.html>Brooke Smith Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-is-fai-khadra-related-to-the-kardashians.html>How is fai Khadra related to the Kardashians?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
