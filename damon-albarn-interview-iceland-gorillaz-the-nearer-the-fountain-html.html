The singer-songwriter made a name for himself in the ’90s on records like Blur’s Parklife and The Great Escape, both lively rock albums that doubled as smart surveys of a certain dour, uniquely English temperament. The records he has made since then tend to defer to other voices and players and genres. Gorillaz albums over the past 20 years have been tapestries weaving rockers, rappers, and others into unpredictable psychedelic sound sculptures. Projects like the Good, the Bad, and the Queen — featuring the frequent Albarn collaborators Simon Tong of the Verve, Paul Simonon of the Clash, and <a href=#>the late Afrobeat pioneer Tony Allen</a> — search for delicate musical multiculturalism in their blend and balance of international rhythms.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckwchoqho009z3e6kmv497a3b@published data-word-count=127>On this month’s The Nearer the Fountain, the More Pure the Stream Flows, Albarn’s second official solo album after the languid, gorgeous 2014 album Everyday Robots, the feel of Iceland bleeds into the sound of the music, just as the sound and spirit of the summer Gorillaz EP Meanwhile were informed by the British Caribbean culture the artist took in at the Notting Hill Carnival growing up. When I spoke to Albarn over Zoom last month, he showed me a breathtaking, snowcapped<strong> </strong>scene through the window of his Icelandic home that at once explained the chilly, ambient sonics populating these new songs. Place this man anywhere on the map, and given the right amount of time, he will turn over a gorgeous musical catalogue of his travels.</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckwcc3g4500113e6kia725hb8@published data-word-count=110><strong>Am I to understand that you originally intended to make an opera instead of your new album?</strong><br>Not an opera but an orchestral piece. It came out of a fantastic offer to do anything I wanted with this particular orchestra, I think based in Paris, mainly. And I thought about it for a while: That’s an amazing opportunity. I can get a group of great musicians to sit in my front room in Iceland. In fact, I’m going to show you what the view looks like so that you get an understanding because it’s actually quite hard to set the mood properly without a picture … [searches for the right angle].</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckwcc3msk001b3e6kbsgfw0p7@published data-word-count=140><strong>That’ll do it.</strong><br>That’ll do it. Exactly. So I had this opportunity to get these musicians together and we basically had three sessions a week where they’d come early in the morning. Depending on what time of year it was — sometimes it was pitch-black even at ten in the morning — everyone would sit down, have a coffee, and then wait for light. I would have harmonic destinations for them to reach and little melodic motifs but nothing really heavy. I’d assign them different parts of the landscape. Some musicians would concentrate on the mountain and what was happening, whether there was mist coming over it or whether there was snow falling on it. Other people would be concerned with the wind, the sea, and the birds, even. I’d have golfers as well, directly outside the window, so golf carts.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckwcc3msm001d3e6kj3s0cewh@published data-word-count=149><strong>When music critics write that a piece is “cinematic,” that’s often what we’re talking about — the fact that it’s evocative of a physical space. I feel like you’re trying to translate the landscape in Iceland into sound.</strong><br>Yeah. A bit, yeah. And it was going really, really well, and then the pandemic hit and everything was closed down. So I had all these amazing rehearsal tapes but nothing concrete; I was left with half a project, really. And I left it for a while and then towards the latter end of last year, I thought, I’ve got to somehow put all the pieces I have together and make something because I need to articulate something. This has got such a perfect mood for how I feel about now. So I started writing the songs and finishing songs based on the ideas that had accumulated while I was in Iceland.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckwcc3msm001f3e6kz7m224si@published data-word-count=116>I traveled back to places I’d been, like Iran and Tower of Montevideo, to get a bit of fantasy in there, just to express how I was feeling. Then I got two of my old friends to come down to where I was living in Devon by the sea in January of this year. We set up old, dusty, cranky keyboards and guitar and a saxophone and an old Wurlitzer drum machine from the 1950s and imagined we were a house band on a cruise ship that just had been left anchored somewhere off the coast of wherever. There was nobody on it, so we just played to an empty ballroom every night on the boat.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckwcc3msn001g3e6k08zgeims@published data-word-count=58><strong>So this project starts out as more of an instrumental endeavor and then you push it to more of a pop space?</strong><br>There’s a lot more instrumental to come because next year I get to work with the orchestra again and sew the orchestral tapestry onto this, see how it all feels — really make it really, really cinematic.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckwcc3mso001i3e6km51a8gpa@published data-word-count=157><strong>Tonally and maybe lyrically, this one’s a bit sad, or at least, to me, evocative of a kind of darkness. I’m curious what brought that out.</strong><strong><br></strong>Well, I mean, it was cold, wet, really windy and dusty where I was recording in an old barn by the sea in January. Light’s really poor that time of year. So that was quite oppressive. Three of us were playing in duffle coats and had gloves on at some points while we were recording because it was unbearably cold. The electricity burnt out loads of times because all the heaters we were running just kept exploding, and the instruments weren’t working a lot of the time. So they had to be fixed every morning and then they’d last a few hours and they’d just go crazy. So there was this real tension. I suppose I wasn’t intentionally trying to sound sad but, specially back then, the pandemic was really brutal here.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckwcc3msq001j3e6kwgqp87t8@published data-word-count=17><strong>Where did you spend that time?</strong><br>I spent most of it down there by the sea in Devon.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckwcc3mt0001l3e6kh4k7onld@published data-word-count=15><strong>Things seemed really intense in the U.K. last year.</strong><br>Yeah, I wish I’d been in Iceland.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckwcc3mt1001n3e6kummibhsh@published data-word-count=15><strong>Iceland seems to be handling things better.</strong><br>They have space and they’re very pragmatic, sensible Scandinavians.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckwcc3mt2001p3e6kzub6fvkb@published data-word-count=80><strong>What motivated you to apply for Icelandic citizenship this year?</strong><br>It was put to me that if I would like to become a citizen, it was possible I could. So I didn’t really do much applying. It was something that was offered to me. I was obviously very touched by the offer.

But this lovely old lady sat down next to me and proceeded to talk to me, and at first I was like, Oh my God, this is my worst nightmare. But turned out, she was the most amazing woman. She was a rabbi born in Winnipeg who now lives in Vancouver. We had this fantastic conversation that started with Trump. She said, “Don’t worry about Trump. He’s just a disrupter. He’s not going to have any lasting legacy, but it’s important that people like him stir stuff up so that the particles can energize and disperse.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckwcc3mt6001w3e6kvl061n8g@published data-word-count=87>I wanted to try and find a way to express my awe of witnessing the northern lights. And it’s a similar thing. These disruptive particles come — at the moment, there’s been a big solar flare — they come and they hit the surface of the earth and they cause disruption, but we get this joyous light show out of it.
