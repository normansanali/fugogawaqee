resources that the US military can call on.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It’s becoming increasingly difficult – Australia is to a degree isolated,’ Prof Rothwell of Australian National University told the ABC.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It is clear there is a pattern associated with Australia’s activities now [that is] very much aligned with the way in which the United States conducts similar activities.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It needs to be accepted that Australia is often sailing through those waters on their own without a lot of back-up, in the way that the US Navy would often have.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The fears were echoed by former defence personnel minister Darren Chester.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘What concerns me is there’s more likely to be some incident at a future point resulting from a level of misadventure or miscalculation or mistake being made than an actual act of aggression,’ the Nationals MP said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘We need to be very careful and need to make sure we are working closely with our allies. I think it is really important that we try and de-escalate these situations wherever possible.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘At the same time, we have every right to be there.
