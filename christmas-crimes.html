When the smoke cleared, George and Jennie Sodder were devastated to discover that five of their 10 children had apparently been unable to escape the blaze. But as the years passed, the couple became convinced that their missing children hadn’t died in the fire at all.</p><p>Though there was no sign of the missing <a href=# rel=noopener>Sodder children</a>, Maurice (14), Martha (12), Louis (nine), Jennie (eight), and Betty (five), investigators also didn’t find any of their remains in the house. And as a crematorium worker told Jennie, bones take around two hours to burn into ashes. The Sodder home was only on fire for 45 minutes before the flames went out.</p><p>What’s more, a number of odd incidents had bookended the children’s disappearance. Before the fire, an insurance salesman had told George Sodder that his home would go up in smoke because he’d criticized Benito Mussolini, angering Italian Americans in town. And during the blaze, George had found his ladder missing and both his trucks unable to start.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-406609 alt="Sodder Children Memorial" width=900 height=677 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sodder-children-memorial.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-406609 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Public Domain</span><span class=caption-body>A memorial pleading for information about the missing Sodder children decades after they vanished in 1945.</span></p><p>Were the missing Sodder children victims of a Christmas murder? Or did something more complicated happen that night on Dec. 25, 1945? To date, the answer depends on who you ask. George and Jennie spent the rest of their lives believing that their five children had been kidnapped in retaliation.</p><p>Indeed, sightings of the Sodder children were reported after the fire. Some locals believe that they saw the children watching the blaze from a passing car, and a woman who owned a truck stop 50 miles away claimed that she saw the children with Italian-speaking adults on the day after Christmas.</p><p>In 1968, Jennie even received a photo of a man who claimed to be Louis, but efforts to find him went nowhere. George died that year, and Jennie passed away in 1989. Since then, this Christmas mystery has endured.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyktNGiqq2lkah6pL7IppysZ2M%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./environmental-impact-assessment-of-the-2024-paris-olympics.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Environmental Impact Assessment of the 2024 Paris Olympics</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./yolanda-saldivar.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Yolanda Saldivar</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-awesome-easter-eggs-hidden-in-the-resident-evil-4-remake.html>12 awesome Easter Eggs hidden in the Resident Evil 4 Remake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./summer-tv-preview-2020-shows-to-watch-4073529.html>13 Reasons Why &amp;amp; More Shows To Watch Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aerodactyl-gl-rising-rivals-55.html>Aerodactyl GL (Rising Rivals 55)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-smith-net-worth-132013.html>Brooke Smith Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-is-fai-khadra-related-to-the-kardashians.html>How is fai Khadra related to the Kardashians?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
