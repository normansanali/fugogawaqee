See it here.</p><p class="font-weight-normal about-author">By <a href=# title="Faith McKay">Faith McKay</a> | <span class=date>Published 3 years ago</span></p><p>This article is more than 2 years old</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/turner-and-hooch-900x471.jpg><p>It’s true. Tom Hanks, who played Turner in the <a href=#>original</a> Turner & Hooch from 1989, suffers an ill fate in the trailer for the new Disney+ series. Toward the beginning of the video for the Turner & Hooch series, they kill off Tom Hanks. That’s one way to do a reboot.</p><p>Below, you can watch the trailer for the new series, where the fate of Tom Hanks is established.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Early on in the trailer, we learn that our main character, played by Josh <a href=#>Peck</a>, is getting a dog. This is not a dog he asked for. It’s been gifted to him. His sister is dropping it off, and she asks him, “Didn’t mom call you?” When he jumps on the phone with her, she says, “Your father wanted you to have Hooch. He rescued him from the shelter.” This is the line that lets you know that Tom Hanks was our main character’s father, and he’s dead. Good luck refusing a gift from your father, especially when your father is the <a href=#>lovable</a> Tom Hanks, and especially when he has recently passed away. We see that our main character has a note from his departed father, which we hear via voiceover says, “Everything I care about in my life started with a dog.”</p><p>The note also acknowledges that our main character doesn’t want a dog, which is similar in story to the original Turner & Hooch movie starring Tom Hanks, though in that story it was really the main character’s decision, not guilt from his departed father.</p><p>Do you think they let Tom Hanks know that he died, or just let him find out via the internet? In the original film, he plays Turner, a detective. He gets a dog, named Hooch, as part of his plans for finding a killer. The dog is wild and behaves for other people, but never for Turner, who doesn’t seem to take to dogs. He’s career-focused and unhappy with his current work. He wants high-profile cases. It seems to him that the dog is his ticket to proving himself. The movie follows a buddy-cop plot, but with a dog. On a budget of $13 million, the Tom Hanks film made $71 million at the worldwide <a href=#>box office</a> and was a huge hit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/josh-peck-900x600.jpg><p>Now, thirty years later, Disney+ wants to come back with the same universe and a new Hooch. To their credit, the new dog looks incredibly like the original Hooch. They’ve also come up with a story that seems like it will hit all the same notes as the original, while still being its own story in a way that makes sense and doesn’t require new audiences to have seen the original movie. The series doesn’t have Tom Hanks, but it wouldn’t be the same story with an older version of his character anyway, right? Turner learned what he needed to from his best friend. Now, they have Josh Peck, who believably looks like he could be playing the son of the original character. Peck is also a Turner, known as Scott Turner in the new series, which is said to have 12 episodes.</p><p>You’ll be able to see the new Turner & Hooch on <a href=#>Disney+</a> on July 21.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2isn6J6qa3NpKpmo5mhuaawjKidn2aYqbqt</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-jacqueline-laurita-from-rhonj-doing-today.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Is Jacqueline Laurita From RHONJ Doing Today?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./todd-carmichael-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-578687-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Todd Carmichael Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-awesome-easter-eggs-hidden-in-the-resident-evil-4-remake.html>12 awesome Easter Eggs hidden in the Resident Evil 4 Remake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./summer-tv-preview-2020-shows-to-watch-4073529.html>13 Reasons Why &amp;amp; More Shows To Watch Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aerodactyl-gl-rising-rivals-55.html>Aerodactyl GL (Rising Rivals 55)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-smith-net-worth-132013.html>Brooke Smith Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-is-fai-khadra-related-to-the-kardashians.html>How is fai Khadra related to the Kardashians?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
