Only this time, the material is from William Shakespeare, and Leonardo DiCaprio gets cast as the Romeo to her modern-day Juliet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Directed by Baz Luhrmann, Romeo + Juliet would go on to score an Oscar nod. And while the movie received a lot of praise, there were also <a href=#>reports of tension between the two lead stars</a> behind the scenes. It was even further claimed that things between Danes and DiCaprio got so bad that she reportedly <a href=#>turned down playing Rose opposite the actor</a> in James Cameron’s Titanic.</p><p>After that, Danes would go on to a series of ensemble films, including the film adaptation of Les Misérables with Liam Neeson, Uma Thurman, and Geoffrey Rush; The Hours with Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, and Julianne Moore; and The Family Stone with Diane Keaton, Sarah Jessica Parker, Dermot Mulroney, Rachel McAdams, Craig T. Nelson, and Luke Wilson. At the same time, Danes tries her hand at action, joining Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the actress also did a few TV appearances over the years, Danes made a full-time return to television with a starring role in the Showtime series Homeland where she played Carrie Mathison, a bipolar CIA operative who is determined to prove that an American prisoner of war (played by Damian Lewis) has already been turned by al-Qaeda.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Leonardo DiCaprio And Claire Danes Fall In Love Filming 'Romeo + Juliet'?</a></span></p><p>While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">speaking with Vulture</a> after Homeland wrapped up its first season, Danes revealed that she wasn’t exactly thinking about returning to TV, although she was that it was a “potentially good environment” for her.</p><p>When she learned about Carrie though, it piqued her interest as the character was both “distressed” and “really, really fascinating.” Danes also admitted that she doesn’t always get that “many opportunities to play people this surprising and this complex.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Little did the actress know that her decision to do the series would pay off big time. Throughout the show’s eight-season run, Danes won two Emmys for Oustanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series.</p><p>Just a couple of years later, Danes also went on to delve into miniseries. For starters, she starred opposite Tom Hiddleston in the critically acclaimed fantasy drama The Essex Serpent. Around the same time, Danes also joined Jesse Eisenberg, Lizzy Caplan, and Adam Brody in the FX drama Fleishman Is in Trouble.</p><h2 id=claire-danes-is-worth-35-million>Claire Danes Is Worth $35 Million</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/claire-danes-red-dress-on-the-red-carpet.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Danes’ estimated net worth is respectable, some may argue that the actress should be worth more considering her decades of work in film and television. It is also worth noting that Danes had booked starring roles early on in her career, although her salaries for both My So-Called Life and Romeo + Juliet were never disclosed.</p><p>It is also unclear how much the actress earned for the ensemble films she worked on in the years that followed.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Famous Actress Nearly Played Juliet Instead Of Claire Danes</a></span></p><p>That said, Danes also managed to land several endorsement deals over the years. Back in 2007, the actress memorably <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">headlined Gap’s TV campaign</a> alongside Insidious star Patrick Wilson where Danes promoted Gap’s boyfriend trousers for women.</p><p>Soon after, she became <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the new face of Gucci Jewelry</a>.

During the show’s early seasons, reports claimed that the actress received around $250,000 per episode, which was already higher than other TV salaries at that time.</p><p>As the show became successful though, it is believed that Danes got herself a nice salary bump, bringing up her rate to a reported $450,000 per episode. Not only that, but the actress also received an executive producer credit for Homeland later on.</p><h2 id=is-claire-danes-still-acting-today>Is Claire Danes Still Acting Today?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/claire-danes-on-the-set-of-fleishman-is-in-trouble-with-lizzy-caplan.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the moment, Danes seems to be taking it easy. After all, the award-winning actress recently gave birth to her third child with husband Hugh Dancy, so it's fair to say that Danes might not do as much tv (or film) work as she typically does.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Claire Danes Really Thinks About Her Controversial Fleishman Is In Trouble Character</a></span></p><p>That said, she has taken on some recent work.
