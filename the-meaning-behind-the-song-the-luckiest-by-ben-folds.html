When we got married, I wanted to write a song that would truly capture my feelings for her. I wanted to express the fact that I know how lucky I am to have her in my life.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Lyrics_Interpretation></span>The Lyrics Interpretation<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The lyrics of “The Luckiest” are incredibly meaningful, and they have been interpreted in several ways. Some people think the song is about the thrill of meeting someone special, while others believe it is about the fear of losing someone you love.</p><p>One interpretation of the song’s lyrics is that they describe the fear of opening up to someone and letting them see your true self. Folds sings, “I feel like a quote out of a book,” which could be interpreted as meaning that he feels like a cliche or a stereotype instead of a unique and complex person. He also talks about how he doesn’t want to “be somebody’s missed opportunity,” which could be interpreted as a fear of giving too much and then being rejected or abandoned.</p><p>Another interpretation of the song is that it is about the joy and wonder of finding someone who truly understands and loves you. Folds sings, “I don’t get many things right the first time / In fact, I am told that a lot / Now I know all the wrong turns the stumbles and falls / Brought me here,” which seems to suggest that he has made mistakes in the past but that they have led him to the person he loves.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Music_Analysis></span>The Music Analysis<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“The Luckiest” is a beautiful, melodic song that features Folds’ signature piano playing and expressive vocals. The instrumentation is simple and understated, which allows the lyrics to shine through.</p><p>The song starts with a simple piano riff that repeats throughout the song. Folds then begins to sing in his distinctively raw, emotive style. The chorus is especially powerful, with Folds singing, “And where was I before the day / That I first saw your lovely face? / Now I see it every day / And I know that I am / I am / I am the luckiest.”</p><p>One notable aspect of the song’s structure is the way that it builds to a climax at the end. The first verse and chorus are relatively subdued, but as the song progresses, Folds adds more layers of instrumentation and intensifies his vocals. The final chorus is especially impactful, with Folds practically shouting the final lines.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Legacy_of_The_Song></span>The Legacy of The Song<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“The Luckiest” has had a lasting impact on fans and critics alike. The song has been used in several films and TV shows, including “How I Met Your Mother,” “Scrubs,” and “The West Wing.” It has also been covered by several other artists, including Taylor Swift and Joshua Radin.</p><p>Critics have praised the song for its emotional honesty and simplicity. Ben Hogwood of musicOMH called it “a tear-jerking beauty,” while Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone said that it was “one of the most simple and heartfelt love songs of the new millennium.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Lyrics></span>The Lyrics<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The lyrics of “The Luckiest” are incredibly poignant and heartfelt. Here is the full text of the song:</p><p>I don’t get many things right the first time<br>In fact, I am told that a lot<br>Now I know all the wrong turns, the stumbles and falls<br>Brought me here</p><p>And where was I before the day<br>That I first saw your lovely face?<br>Now I see it every day<br>And I know</p><p>That I am, I am<br>I am the luckiest</p><p>What if I’d been born fifty years before you<br>In a house on a street where you lived?<br>Maybe I’d be outside as you passed on your bike<br>Would I know?</p><p>And in a wide sea of eyes<br>I see one pair that I recognize<br>And I know</p><p>That I am, I am<br>I am the luckiest</p><p>I love you more than I have<br>Ever found a way to say to you</p><p>Next door there’s an old man who lived to his nineties<br>And one day passed away in his sleep<br>And his wife, she stayed for a couple of days<br>And passed away</p><p>I’m sorry, I know that’s a strange way<br>To tell you that I know we belong<br>That I know</p><p>That I am, I am, I am<br>The luckiest</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Frequently_Asked_Questions></span>Frequently Asked Questions<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_inspired_Ben_Folds_to_write_%E2%80%9CThe_Luckiest%E2%80%9D></span>What inspired Ben Folds to write “The Luckiest”?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Ben Folds wrote “The Luckiest” as a gift for his wife, Frally Hynes.
