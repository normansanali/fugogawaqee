Let's take a look at what fans really think.</p><h2 id=fan-reaction>Fan Reaction</h2><p><a href=#>Emma Roberts shared a funny story about her mom</a>, as Emma's mother talked about Emma's pregnancy on social media before Emma herself got a chance to.</p><p>But while fans love hearing Emma's hilarious family stories, and she always looks fashionable on her Instagram, the star was once involved in a disturbing situation with her ex-partner Evan Peters.</p><p>When talking about the relationship that the actress once had with Evan Peters, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emma Roberts's 2013 arrest</a> stands out. According to Page Six, the couple was staying at a hotel in Montreal and they allegedly got into an argument. It seems like Emma hurt Evan as he had a bloody nose. While the actors did get engaged, they split up in 2015.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This was definitely a disturbing time in Emma's career, as according to TMZ, Evan Peters also had a bite mark.</p><p>When a fan shared a news story about Emma and Evan in a Reddit thread, someone replied, "Every time I hear this story, I'm reminded of similar reports that emerged of her dad Eric Roberts doing the same things to Emma's mother." They mentioned "the cycle of domestic violence."</p><p>An <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AP News story from February 1995</a> reported that Eric Roberts was arrested for "investigation of spousal abuse." According to the article, Eric allegedly "pushed his wife into a wall." This seems to be what the fan on Reddit was referring to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Emma Roberts' 10 Best Maternity Instagram Looks</a></span></p><p>Some fans talk about the fact that Emma had bruised legs, which suggests that the abuse was not one-sided, and there are many who love watching Emma in movies and on American Horror Story who feel that she and Evan were both in the wrong.</p><p>A fan started a Reddit thread talking about "the unnecessary Emma Roberts hate" and wrote, "And before people bring up the abuse scandal, she had very visible bruises all over her legs so all we know, it could’ve been self defense, so if u cancel Emma you better cancel Evan too."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another fan shared that it seems like Emma and Evan realize that they made mistakes and they have moved on: the fan wrote, "They both were able to put it behind them, and there were no rumors of another incident. I think she’s grown as a person, and she rose to the occasion of leading AHS this year."</p><p>When a fan asked "why all the Emma Roberts hate" on Reddit, a few people defended her acting ability and said that she's really talented. Someone brought up the 2013 incident and said, "I think more people are upset about the abuse scandal though" and someone replied, "I think that's the main issue here."</p><p>According to TMZ.com, "Sources close to Emma tell TMZ ... Emma and Evan were hitting each other and she was arrested because he had obvious physical injuries.

While Emma didn't specifically talk about her situation with Evan Peters or her 2013 arrest, she did say that the press says certain things and her friends and family know the real story, so people think that she was talking about this incident in this interview.</p><p>Emma said, "I think I know what's true, and I know what happened in my own life and so do the people who love me and who I love."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Emma Roberts Opens Up About Her Struggles With Medical Bias, Endometriosis, and Fertility</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A source told Us Weekly that Evan and Emma's romance turned really sour. The source said, “Evan was so in love with Emma and their relationship became very toxic. They had the highest highs and then would not speak for days. He took a long time of figuring himself out again before he was ready to date.” In 2019, Evan and Halsey were romantically linked, but their relationship didn't last. The couple broke up in 2020, according to Cheat Sheet.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>10 Posts On Emma Roberts Instagram To Inspire Your Sense Of Fashion</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrOiutJmqZ6ZnKHGbsDHoqWkZZ%2Bbeqa5zJpkq6eSmr%2B1v4yama6rlWLApK3NnZilZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-happened-to-kris-bryant.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Happened To Kris Bryant?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-does-an-defensive-coordinator-do.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What does an defensive coordinator do?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-awesome-easter-eggs-hidden-in-the-resident-evil-4-remake.html>12 awesome Easter Eggs hidden in the Resident Evil 4 Remake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./summer-tv-preview-2020-shows-to-watch-4073529.html>13 Reasons Why &amp;amp; More Shows To Watch Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aerodactyl-gl-rising-rivals-55.html>Aerodactyl GL (Rising Rivals 55)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-smith-net-worth-132013.html>Brooke Smith Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-is-fai-khadra-related-to-the-kardashians.html>How is fai Khadra related to the Kardashians?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
