For the first season, that adds up to $540,000. In the second season, their pay went up to $40,000 per episode, which is the same as $960,000 per year.</p><p>Before their contracts ran out at the start of the third season, the main cast decided to work together to renegotiate their new deals. After a successful round of talks, the studio agreed to pay each main cast member $75,000 per episode during season three. This is the same as making $1,875,000 per year.</p><p>This new contract also said that the pay would go up as the seasons went on. In season four, the main cast of Friends made $85,000 per episode or $2.04 million per year. In season five, they made $100,000 per episode or $2.5 million per year, and in season six, they made $125,000 per episode or $3.125 million per year.</p><p>But that group of people wasn’t done yet. Before season seven started, the cast went back to the table to talk about more demands. Because the cast stuck together and fought as one, the studio had no choice but to give them what they wanted: $750,000 per episode in seasons seven and eight, which is equal to $18 million per season.</p><p>For seasons nine and ten, this crazy-rich new contract also set a price of $1 million per episode. Friends’ main cast made a total of $24 million for season nine and $18 million for season ten. David Schwimmer and the rest of the main cast made a total of about $90 million from the show, and that’s just from their base salaries.

They’re both attorneys. So good marks, getting through university, there was a huge emphasis and pressure to do well and keep going.”<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“When I was six years old, my parents took me to this farmers market with a petting zoo. They put me on a pony and, for some reason, it took off at a run and they had to chase it down. They tell me it was kind of traumatic.”&nbsp;</p><p>“I think I’m a very very nice director. Very supportive, very nurturing. I definitely try to challenge my actors but I think I’m very supportive.”&nbsp;</p><p>“I think the other honest attraction was that I just grew up loving watching TV and loving watching film, and there are so many directors and actors that I dreamed of working with, I just really wanted to take a crack at it and see if I could ever work with some of those.”</p><p>“If I were given a choice between two films and one was dark and explored depraved, troubled or sick aspects of our culture, I would always opt for that over the next romantic comedy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX5mut7XDZqqcoKeeuq6x0WalnqxdrLyzwMdmaWlqYmKurrHRopqapl2WsLW70WaboqqVmMGwvoyapZ1loKe8pcHCnqlmnZGnu6q6xqxma2tnZYVw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dion-takes-on-tons-of-zombies-in-the-trailer-for-raising-dion-season-2-watch-here.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dion Takes on Tons of Zombies in the Trailer for 'Raising Dion' Season 2 - Watch Here!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cora-miao.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Cora Miao Biography, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth, Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-awesome-easter-eggs-hidden-in-the-resident-evil-4-remake.html>12 awesome Easter Eggs hidden in the Resident Evil 4 Remake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./summer-tv-preview-2020-shows-to-watch-4073529.html>13 Reasons Why &amp;amp; More Shows To Watch Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aerodactyl-gl-rising-rivals-55.html>Aerodactyl GL (Rising Rivals 55)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-smith-net-worth-132013.html>Brooke Smith Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-is-fai-khadra-related-to-the-kardashians.html>How is fai Khadra related to the Kardashians?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
