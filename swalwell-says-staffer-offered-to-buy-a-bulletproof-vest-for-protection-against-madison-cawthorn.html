will end in ‘bloodshed.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Then on Monday night, Swalwell suggested he fears that Cawthorn could violently lash out in a way that would require him to have a bulletproof

about people like Cawthorn — NOT even people outside of my office building — BUT inside.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The House now allows lawmakers to expense bulletproof vests if they desire one– an obvious response to the January 6 attack on the Capitol that resulted in five deaths as rioters protested the 2020 presidential election results in the aftermath of a ‘Stop the Steal’ rally.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The congressman’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Swalwell’s tweet.&nbsp;</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async
