Pauly D spoke to 'Distractify' about location details.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>The 'Jersey Shore: Family Vacation' cast.</p></figure><p>It has been a while since the cast of <a href=#>Jersey Shore: Family Vacation</a> actually filmed the show full-time in New Jersey. There's a reason why it's called Vacation, after all. During both parts of <a href=#>Season 5</a>, the cast traveled somewhere new — so where was Season 5 filmed? During the past couple of seasons, the cast went to Las Vegas and the Poconos to safely and easily film together.</p><p>This time around, they're in a couple of new locations. The cast also grew by one since <a href=#>Mike and Lauren Sorrentino</a> welcomed their new baby after filming ended for Season 4.</p><p>Things are a lot less dramatic, and the partying atmosphere is far more subdued these days, as all of the cast members have begun to get married, settle down, and start families. However, that just means the filming locations have to be more and more exciting.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram / @jwoww</span><p>'Jersey Shore: Family Vacation' Season 5 was filmed partly in Florida.</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where was 'Jersey Shore: Family Vacation' Season 5 filmed?</h2><p>The Jersey Shore: Family Vacation cast traveled south to Florida to film the first part of Season 5. Although they were all pretty mum about where in Florida they filmed, some eagle-eyed viewers were able to track down the resort they stayed and filmed in: the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Isla Bella Resort</a>. Because the resort has an online webcam feed, fans shared screenshots on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> in November 2021 in which it appeared that some cast and crew members were at the resort.</p><p>Although no one on the show tagged Isla Bella Resort on social media, we can all but confirm that's where they were. Lauren shared an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> photo on Nov. 6, 2021, in which she and Mike stood on a patio with their son. The patio is the exact same one you'd find at the resort, so the rumor about the cast filming at the Florida resort checks out.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by DJ Pauly D (@djpaulyd)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Pauly D shares where 'Jersey Shore: Family Vacation' Part 2 filmed.</h2><p>In an exclusive interview with Distractify, Pauly D shared where he and the rest of the cast traveled to film the second part of Jersey Shore: Family Vacation Season 5.</p><p>"We did a couple of trips," Pauly D shared. "We did one in El Paso, Texas. I had a gig out there, so we just made a few days out of it, made a little vacation ... We got to do some Texas things [like] line dancing. We got the full Texas experience, I guess you could say, out there, and then we just wrapped in San Diego. And [when the rest of the cast] brought their families, we did family days and pretty much everything that San Diego has to offer."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Snooki is back full-time for Season 5.</h2><p>Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi joined the cast toward the end of Jersey Shore: Family Vacation Season 4. After a long hiatus from the series to spend time at home with her family, Snooki is back in full force for Season 5. And now that her fellow "<a href=#>meatball</a>" Deena Cortese is no longer pregnant, the two definitely had their meatball days in the Florida Keys.</p><p>"I'm ready to be back," Snooki told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TooFab</a> in September 2021. "I kind of needed, like, a mental health day. You know how you take that for work? So I had a mental health off-season, just 'cause I needed, like, to get myself back together."</p><p>She told the outlet at the time that she planned to be in Season 5 as much as possible.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram / @jwoww</span><p>Some of the 'Jersey Shore: Family Vacation' cast.</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Pauly D also hinted at more drama in Season 5.</h2><p>According to Pauly D, just because the Jersey Shore: Family Vacation cast is as close as a real life family, it doesn't mean everyone gets along 100 percent of the time. In fact, viewers can expect more drama going into the second half of Season 5.</p><p>"For some reason. I don't know why, [in] this family we have so much drama when we get together, and you'll see a lot of that this season," Pauly D told Distractify.</p><p>It's all in a day's work as a cast member on Jersey Shore: Family Vacation, though — and it probably wouldn't be a season without someone making drama out of nothing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmrpqrXZ%2Bys7%2FEsmSsoJ%2Bnsm6ywKagpbFdq66krdOipqdlo5qutLvNZmxmnpmhuqaw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./teddy-hart-arrested-on-multiple-possession-charges.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Teddy Hart Arrested On Multiple Possession Charges</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nidoking-151-34.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nidoking (151 34) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-awesome-easter-eggs-hidden-in-the-resident-evil-4-remake.html>12 awesome Easter Eggs hidden in the Resident Evil 4 Remake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./summer-tv-preview-2020-shows-to-watch-4073529.html>13 Reasons Why &amp;amp; More Shows To Watch Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aerodactyl-gl-rising-rivals-55.html>Aerodactyl GL (Rising Rivals 55)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-smith-net-worth-132013.html>Brooke Smith Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-is-fai-khadra-related-to-the-kardashians.html>How is fai Khadra related to the Kardashians?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
