But </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Street Outlaws</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> star Jason Cantu and wife Jessica Olvera shared a beautiful relationship, which lasted for over 24 years.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, who is Jason’s patient wife? Get to know about Jessica Olvera as this article continues.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Jessica Olvera, Street Outlaws Jason Cantu Wife</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>You might be surprised but Jessica Olvera and Jason Cantu weren’t even engaged until 2021. Yes! It was only on Valentine’s Day 2021 that the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Street Outlaws</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> star proposed to Jessica with a beautiful diamond ring which he flaunted over his FB.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>At the time, he wrote, “Happy Valentine’s Day to my sweetheart Jessica Olvera… Love you. Even though we’ve been together for 23 years, we’ve always seen ourselves as a married couple. I think it’s time we make it official… She was surprised.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The duo officially began their relationship on April 24, 1998.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Multiple sites even mentioned that the couple shares two kids — which isn’t true. The baby, Justin Robert, many might have confused as Jessica’s kid, is her nephew.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, the duo does share a few dogs that they labeled as their “babies.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to Jessica, she felt “lucky to have found” Jason and hoped to spend the rest of her life with him.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Likewise, Jason is grateful to have met someone who also shared a passion for the automobile.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As of 2022, Jason rode a heavily modified Chevrolet S-10 packed with over 1,500 horsepower named&nbsp; “La Vicktoria”. His truck was also considered one of Texas’ top </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>No Prep </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>small tire vehicles. But when he wasn’t racing, Jason worked as a mechanic</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Reportedly, he pocked a handsome salary of $20,000 to $30,000 per episode on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Street Outlaws</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. But then again considering the risk of street racing, no money would be enough to put one’s life on the line.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Back when Jason raced Jackie Knox Sr at Edinburg Motorsports Park, his truck climbed the railing before flipping multiple times. Luckily, Jason escaped the incident unscathed.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But Jason’s most viral moments on the show would certainly be his scuffle with fellow star Brian “Chucky” Davis.</span></p><h3><b>Jessica Olvera Age</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jessica Olvera was 42 years of age in 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>She is the same age as her husband Jason.</span></p><h3><b>Jessica Olvera Job</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jessica Olvera is a design professional.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>A design professional includes the Architect, the Architect’s sub-consultants, and the design consultants engaged directly by the Design-Builder or Project Co.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Unfortunately, we do not exactly know what her job was.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But we’ve spotted Jessica quite a few times behind the screen of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Street Outlaws</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. So, she must have worked with the show’s production team.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In Feb 2018, Jessica even posted an FB pic from her “special job” on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Street Outlaws</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> captioned, “Yesterday’s races…I felt so important with the special job I was assigned…had so much fun being behind the scenes!”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>On her </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>LinkedIn</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, she also mentioned herself to be a “provider” ever since 2010.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>When Jessica wasn’t working, she was often seen reading books. In fact, Jessica is a book fanatic, who rarely missed book conferences. So far, she’s been to Book Bonanza 2018, TLA Dallas, and TLA 2019 Austin, TX.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“Another conference in the books! Nothing better than a conference where you can meet authors and be surrounded by books!!” Jessica once explained her passion.</span></p><h3><b>Is Jessica Olvera On IG, Facebook?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>No, as of April 2022, Jessica wasn’t on Instagram.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, you can find her on Facebook at @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>jessica.olvera.39</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Most of her posts then featured her family.</span></p><h3><b>Jessica Olvera Family</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jessica Olvera comes from a family of four.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Unfortunately, her parents are divorced.

She confessed that she saw her mother go through some really hard times and she would cry herself to sleep. But the next morning, she would wake up stronger and even more determined than before.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for Jessica’s siblings, she has a brother named Jesse Robert Olvera who was in the U.S. Army.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jesse was born on Feb 27, 1987, and on his 31st birthday, Jessica took it to her FB to share, “I’m so grateful God chose you as my brother! “I love you Cabron” and know that I will always have your back no matter what!
