The program is presently on hiatus due to the explosive season, so there is no specific news regarding season 13; nonetheless, the housewives were seen reunited at the People’s Choice Awards 2022, and it wasn’t altogether nice.&nbsp;Sutton Stracke compared the event to “the most embarrassing Thanksgiving meal ever”—only a thousand times worse. In an interview with Page Six, she added:</p><p>“It felt uncomfortable, like gritting our teeth.”</p><p>She went on to say that the occasion was made much more unpleasant by the manner they were situated.</p><h2>The cast of RHOBH will appear at the People’s Choice Awards in 2022.</h2><p>The majority of the RHOBH ladies rushed to social media to express how embarrassing the night was. Stracke sat next to her on-screen adversary, Rinna, who was sitting close to her competitor, Kathy.&nbsp;Rinna accused Sutton of attempting to embarrass her during season 12 by alleging that the former and her husband did not thank her for bringing them to Elton John’s annual Oscars philanthropic party last autumn. During one of the instances, a drunk Rinna said:</p><p>“You attempted to make us seem bad. But you embarrassed yourself. You didn’t make any of us feel bad… When you did it, you looked like a f****** idiot.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Syd-McGee-2.jpg alt="Syd McGee" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Hilton was sitting next to Erika Jayne, with Crystal Kung Minkoff on her opposite side. The most recent season of the Bravo reality program included some of the cast’s most heated feuds.&nbsp;Erika called out Kathy at the reunion special for using a homophobic slur during their trip to Aspen. During the show, Kathy, however, disputed the accusation and said that she would never use such words.</p><p>Kathy stated:</p><p>“I will confess what I do, but I will not be represented as the monster you attempted to portray…”</p><p>Her RHOBH co-star cut her off, insisting that they were her words and what she stated straight to her. Andy Cohen told viewers that Bravo HR had begun an inquiry into the situation, but the conclusion was inconclusive since it was a case of “she-said, she-said.”</p><p>The fact that they were sat next to one other was a ticking time bomb, but happily, they grinned the discomfort away rather than flinging hands.</p><p>Stracke elaborated on the exchange by saying:</p><p>“Because it’s so dysfunctional, one of us may say something humorous and we laugh because we feel uncomfortable.” “Someone just say anything,” it’s like.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Sutton-Stracke-1.jpg alt="Sutton Stracke" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The RHOBH star also remarked on Hilton’s use of lip gloss on stage. Since then, the video has gone viral. She went on to say that she didn’t witness the incident since she was too far away, but she feels her co-star didn’t realize the camera was on her.&nbsp;During the event, RHOBH actress Kyle Richards was questioned about the show’s hiatus, and in an interview with Extra, she claimed that she feels pause is simply a buzzword that sounds more dramatic than it is. She also said that they generally begin shooting in April, but that they are beginning a bit later this time.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Socialite</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Sutton Stracke</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqrqykpLtuv9OrmJyjlWKxqr%2FCrqqsnZRirrXAxKeboqaXYsGpsYypnKionJrAbq%2FHqKCcnV2WxKK%2Bw6xksKGknXqztM6bn2abn2LAta3RrGY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-cast-of-dead-to-me-ranked-by-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Cast Of Dead To Me Ranked By Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./shalita-grant.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Shalita Grant Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-awesome-easter-eggs-hidden-in-the-resident-evil-4-remake.html>12 awesome Easter Eggs hidden in the Resident Evil 4 Remake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./summer-tv-preview-2020-shows-to-watch-4073529.html>13 Reasons Why &amp;amp; More Shows To Watch Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aerodactyl-gl-rising-rivals-55.html>Aerodactyl GL (Rising Rivals 55)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-smith-net-worth-132013.html>Brooke Smith Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-is-fai-khadra-related-to-the-kardashians.html>How is fai Khadra related to the Kardashians?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
