There ain’t nothing you can do. They’re not going to do nothing,” the bystander who took the video can be heard saying, seemingly referencing the national string of thefts in which <a href=#>shoplifters raid shelves of supplies</a> before walking out with their loot.</p><p>The green-and-black-clad worker switches from a defensive role when the thief tries to push past him and orders him to move out of the way while he continues his heist.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The thief loaded a garbage can with tobacco items he lifted straight off the shelves of a 7-Eleven. <span class=credit>Instagram</span></figure><p>The employee quickly grapples with the robber and tackles him to the floor, just in time for his co-worker to appear and deliver 23 brutal blows with what appears to be a broomstick.</p><p>The weapon-wielding employee takes a quick break from the whacking — while his co-worker squeezes in a punch of his own to the upper back of the robber — sending the thief writhing chaotically enough to knock over his trove of stolen goods at the feet of his attacker.</p><p>“That’s called whoopin’ your a–! Whoop his a–! Get him!” the bystander says, before asking the thief if he’s ready to give up the heist.</p><p>“Yeah, I’m done!” the robber pleads. “I’m going to go.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The altercation turned physical when the thief tried to push past the employee who had been urging him to stop the heist. <span class=credit>Instagram</span></figure><p>In spite of the surrender, the stick-wielding employee delivers two final whacks while the bystander orders the workers to free the robber.</p><p>“No more! No more!” the cameraman says as the thief screams in pain.</p><p>In subsequent videos shared by the bystander, the employees contemplate calling the police on the thief, but opt to let him walk out empty-handed.</p><p>The bystander walks behind the counter and urges the workers to let the man free before berating the man himself, ordering him not to come back to the 7-Eleven or try stealing again.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">One 7-Eleven employee held the thief down while his co-worker whacked him with a wooden stick. <span class=credit>Instagram</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The thief screamed and pleaded as the worker whacked him 23 times. <span class=credit>Instagram</span></figure><p>The thief claims he was beaten so badly that he can’t stand up and walk out on his own, until the bystander calls his bluff.</p><p>“You better walk tonight,” he says while leading him out of the store.</p><p>Amid his agonized groans and pleas for his freedom, the thief asks whether he can get a soda for the road.</p><p>“What kind of s–t you telling me? You do this s–t and you want a soda? No, no, no. Get the f–k out, man,” the bystander says.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The writhing robber kicked over this garbage can, sending his loot of cigarettes and cigars onto the floor. <span class=credit>Instagram</span></figure><p>Though it is not entirely clear where the incident took place, lottery numbers visible at the beginning of the video indicate it happened in California.</p><p>The cameraman claims it occurred in Stockton, a city roughly 50 miles south of Sacramento, but the police department had not heard of the incident as of Wednesday night.</p><p>A representative from 7-Eleven did not respond to The Post’s request for comment.</p><p>The theft is just one of many in a growing epidemic of&nbsp;<a href=#>organized shoplifting&nbsp;</a>that has affected cities across the country.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The robber tried to claim he was so injured during the attack that he couldn’t walk out of the store. <span class=credit>Instagram</span></figure><p>Last month, three women <a href=#>brazenly wheeled out three shopping carts worth of stolen merchandise </a>that they jacked from a Burlington store.</p><p>A Bay Area family hardware store announced this week that it <a href=#>lost a jarring $700,000 in merchandise</a> in 2022 thanks to rampant shoplifting.</p><p>Retail theft in America has skyrocketed to $94 billion — an alarming 90% increase since 2018, according to the National Retail Federation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3FmaWpfbHqmuMSvnKdlp6S%2FrLHRrGSbnZGpeqSty6JkraCZmrNuss6rZKyslZa5qrrGZqqhnZyrsrR5zp9kraeSlrCku44%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./amber-riley-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Amber Riley Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-beyonce-sent-flowers-to-jack-white-and-sza-sparks-debate.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Beyonc sent flowers to Jack White and SZA sparks debate</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-awesome-easter-eggs-hidden-in-the-resident-evil-4-remake.html>12 awesome Easter Eggs hidden in the Resident Evil 4 Remake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./summer-tv-preview-2020-shows-to-watch-4073529.html>13 Reasons Why &amp;amp; More Shows To Watch Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aerodactyl-gl-rising-rivals-55.html>Aerodactyl GL (Rising Rivals 55)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-smith-net-worth-132013.html>Brooke Smith Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-is-fai-khadra-related-to-the-kardashians.html>How is fai Khadra related to the Kardashians?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
