The premise of browser game is simple enough. All you have to do is follow the game‚Äôs prompts to make the most uncrackable password known to man. Questions one through four are standard password fare, but things quickly start to spiral. The prompts quickly change from the expected ‚Äúadd a special character‚Äù to ‚Äúmake sure your Roman numerals equal a certain amount‚Äù and the more absurd like ‚Äúinclude one of our sponsors‚Äù or ‚Äúguess what country this image is from‚Äù and ‚Äúfind the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Algebraic notation</a> for this specific chess move.‚Äù</p><p data-characters=595 data-current-count=595 data-injectable=true>As the game progresses, your early answers start to gum up the works, and even worse you‚Äôll have to do some internet sleuthing to discover some of the more elusive answers. If you plan on trying to beat the game, you may have to try it several times as it relies on some randomized CAPTCHA prompts, so keep your research tabs open and know that if you intend to take a break and come back tomorrow several of your answers will have to be updated. We didn‚Äôt make it past the Algebraic notation for the sake of time but we did collect some resources for anyone attempting the challenge.<br></p><h2 id=h-who-made-the-password-game data-injectable=false>Who made the Password game?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>The password game is out now!
