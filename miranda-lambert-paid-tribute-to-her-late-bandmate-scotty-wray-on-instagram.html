Wray allegedly died on Friday, February 18, due to heart issues. Lambert included many photos of herself with Wray in her Instagram post. She added a very emotional caption in which she mentioned:</p><p>“Whatever happens. I felt like I could take on the world if he was at my side. Scotty Wray was like family to me, and I’ll never sing a song without knowing he’s beside me.”</p><p>Gwen Sebastian, Lambert’s associate singer-songwriter, also paid homage to Wray on Instagram.</p><h2>All About Scotty Wray</h2><p>Wray is most recognized in the country music field as a guitarist. He was a member of The Wrays, an Oregon-based musical group he co-founded with his brother Collin Raye (aka Bubba Raye). While Scotty Wray’s actual age is unclear, he was thought to be in his mid to late 60s at the time of his death. With decades of expertise as a guitarist, he met Miranda Lambert in 2001 in Greenville, Texas, when she was just 17 years old. Wray was part of Lambert’s artistic journey for nearly 20 years until his death.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Miranda-Lambert-2.jpg alt="Miranda Lambert" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Wray was born in the Arkansas town of De Queen. Lois Wray, his mother, was also a singer-songwriter. In the 1950s, the musician allegedly served as an opening act for singers like Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash. Later, she embarked on a solo career, often bringing her boys to the stage to play with her. At the time, the two boys would provide their mother with harmonic background vocals.</p><p></p><p>Later, in the 1980s, the brothers made a professional debut in the music business. According to his LinkedIn profile, Scotty Wray supposedly lived in Mount Juliet, Tennessee. The late guitarist was also a member of the American Federation of Musicians’ local sections.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Miranda-Lambert-3.jpg alt="Miranda Lambert" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>One of his most recent notable collaborations was with Miranda Lambert and his brother’s duet, Skars, which appeared on Collin Fraye’s 2020 album.
