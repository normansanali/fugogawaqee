It was the most incredible thing. I’ve seen a lot of great things in sports. I started doing this in 1990, but I’ve never seen anything; not like in that in football. I mean wow."</p><p>December 8, 2018 – Johnson called the 2018 Citi Hoops Classic match-up between the Seton Hall Pirates and the 9th ranked Kentucky Wildcats at Madison Square Garden, where <a href=#>Keldon Johnson</a> took a pass from <a href=#>P. J. Washington</a> and made a half-court shot at the buzzer to tie the game at 70. Johnson's call of the final seconds of regulation:</p><p>On May 24, 2017 Fox Sports 1 announced that Johnson would call play-by-play for the inaugural season of BIG3 alongside analyst <a href=#>Jim Jackson</a> and sideline reporter <a href=#>Michael Rapaport</a>.</p><p>September 3, 2017 – Johnson was the play-by-play announcer for the Week 1 matchup between the Texas A&M Aggies and the UCLA Bruins, where UCLA came back from a 34 point deficit to win 45–44, capped off by a fake spike touchdown from <a href=#>Josh Rosen</a> to <a href=#>Jordan Lasley</a> with 43 seconds left to go. Johnson's play of the call:</p><p>October 17, 2017 – As the play-by-play announcer of a college football game between Ohio State and Maryland, Johnson added some playful commentary after Ohio State cornerback <a href=#>Denzel Ward</a> laid a vicious hit on Maryland receiver Taivon Jacobs. Though the play ultimately resulted in Ward's ejection from the game, Johnson's enthusiasm was noted:</p><p>On September 14, 2015, it was announced that <a href=#>Gus Johnson</a> would be the play-by-play announcer for 20 Milwaukee Bucks games for the 2015-2016 season on Fox Sports Wisconsin.</p><p>Johnson is one of the top announcers in sports today. He often uses signature phrases "Hurt My Feelings!", "Oh my goodness!", "Rise and fire... Count it!", "Here comes the pain!", "He's got 'get away from the cops' speed!", "From the parking lot!", "And the Runner....Bang!", "Pure!", "BAM!", "Hot Sauce!", "Cold-Blooded!", "What a game!", "Down the Sideline!" and "HA-HAAA". Despite being known for his catchphrases, Johnson also utilizes silence at opportune times to let television viewers absorb the moment, such as during a 2015 collge football matchup between Notre Dame and Stanford when Stanford kicked the game-winning field goal at the end of a high-scoring game.</p><p>December 5, 2015 – Johnson was the play-by-play announcer for Fox Sports's coverage of the 2015 Big Ten Football Championship Game between the number 5 ranked Michigan State Spartans and the number 4 ranked Iowa Hawkeyes, where Michigan State defeated 16–13, with true freshman running back LJ Scott powering his way for a touchdown with 27 seconds left in the game, giving Michigan State a berth in the 2016 College Football Playoff. Johnson's call of Scott's touchdown:</p><p>In 2012, Johnson served as a radio play-by-play announcer of Major League Soccer's San Jose Earthquakes, working a few of the team's away games on radio. He was being groomed by Fox Sports to be its lead soccer announcer, and called his first UEFA Champions League match on February 13, 2013. It had been anticipated that Johnson would be Fox Sports' lead announcer for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. He is also the lead play-by-play announcer for Fox College Hoops reuniting with <a href=#>Bill Raftery</a>, who works for CBS and formally with ESPN. As of September 15, 2014, Johnson stepped down as lead announcer for Fox Sports' soccer. Johnson just began play-by-play announcing marquee Big Ten regular season football games on Fox Sports during the 2017 season alongside of <a href=#>Joel Klatt</a>. In 2017, they announced "The Game" which features Michigan and Ohio State.</p><p>As Knicks Announcer – With the Knicks, he was well known for some of his calls. For example, one famous Gus line occurs after Knicks forward <a href=#>Al Harrington</a> scores: "My name is <a href=#>Al Harrington</a>... And I get Buckets!" Perhaps Johnson's most famous Knicks call was his enthusiastic and exciting call during Allan Houston's last second shot to knock off the top-seeded Miami Heat in the first round of the 1999 playoffs, en route to an unlikely NBA Finals appearance.</p><p>Johnson: And they'll go ahead and throw it. Batista with THE CAATCH! [Batista shoots before the buzzer, but misses] And that's it! WHAT A COMEBACK! UCLA defeats Gonzaga 73–71 after being down 17!</p><p>Though <a href=#>Gus Johnson</a> received some criticism for this call, it has nonetheless become one of his most famous, as Complex magazine named it his top call in 2013.</p><p>Here's P.J. Washington, he can run the baseline. Throws it, midcourt, <a href=#>Keldon Johnson</a>! [buzzer sounds] OHH! HE BURIED IT! WOW! AND WE'RE – LEVEL AT 70! Whoo! Unbelieveable. And we're going to overtime... at the Garden!</p><p>Before the 2010–11 NBA season, it was announced that Johnson was let go by MSG Network, the television flagship station for the New York Knicks. Johnson explained on February 16, 2012, on the <a href=#>Scott Ferrall</a> Show, that he wanted to leave the Network in order to spend more time with his son.</p><p>Johnson became lead blow-by-blow caller for Showtime Championship Boxing on CBS-owned Showtime, replacing longtime voice Steve Albert. Johnson was also a mixed martial arts commentator for both EliteXC and Strikeforce through mid-2011. Johnson was widely derided for his commentary during the <a href=#>Kimbo Slice</a> vs <a href=#>Seth Petruzelli</a> fight, where he announced that the fight was "the most incredible victory in the history of mixed martial arts".</p><p>CBS released Johnson on May 5, 2011 following a contract dispute. He was still scheduled to call a boxing match between Shane Mosley and Manny Pacquiao for Showtime two days later. On May 9, 2011, Johnson finalized a deal to call college football and NFL telecasts for Fox Sports.</p><p>Johnson called numerous sports for CBS Sports, with his most recognized role as a play-by-play announcer for CBS' March Madness, which he worked each year from 1996 to 2011.

He is also the play-by-play announcer in Madden NFL 12.</p><p>November 14, 2010 – Johnson called a miracle play during a game between the Jacksonville Jaguars and Houston Texans where Jaguars QB David Garrard threw a 50-yard Hail Mary intended for <a href=#>Mike Sims-Walker</a>, but it was batted by Houston safety <a href=#>Glover Quin</a> into the hands of <a href=#>Mike Thomas</a>, whereupon Thomas stepped into the end zone and scored a game-winning touchdown:</p><p>September 14, 2009 – Johnson was calling an NFL regular season opening game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Denver Broncos. During the waning seconds of the game, Denver, down 6–7, needed to drive down the field to get into field goal range or score a touchdown. Quarterback Kyle Orton threw a pass to receiver Brandon Marshall near the sideline. Though the ball was tipped by Bengals defender <a href=#>Leon Hall</a>, it landed into the hands of Broncos receiver <a href=#>Brandon Stokley</a>, who ran it in for an improbable game-winning touchdown. Johnson's call of the play is as follows:</p><p>November 1, 2009 – Johnson was calling another regular season NFL game, this time between the Jacksonville Jaguars and Tennessee Titans when Titans running back Chris Johnson broke away for a 52-yard touchdown. This was Gus Johnson's call:</p><p>In 2008, Johnson handled play-by-play duties for Detroit Lions pre-season games on The Detroit Lions Television Network.</p><p>Johnson has also been an announcer for the Big Ten Network's Sunday Night basketball games since the 2008-2009 season, and was slated to announce 23 games for the network in the 2010-2011 season.</p><p>March 23, 2006 – During the 2006 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, Johnson was calling the Sweet 16 matchup between UCLA and Gonzaga.

He also did NFL games for CBS from 1998–2010.</p><p>Johnson worked for the Madison Square Garden Network (MSG) from 1994–2010, where he was the radio play-by-play and backup television play-by-play announcer of the NBA's New York Knicks, in addition to providing television play-by-play for MSG's coverage of the WNBA's New York Liberty. Johnson has also provided commentary for MSG's coverage of the Golden Gloves Tournament and served as host of the "Yankees ScoreCard" and "SportsDesk", as well as the New York Rangers and Knicks "GameNight." Beginning in 2006, Johnson served as the pre-season TV voice for the Buffalo Bills and Philadelphia Eagles. Johnson also provided play-by-play commentary for the Arena Football League's defunct New York Dragons.</p><p>Johnson hosted ESPN's Black College Sports Today in 1991. After brief stints as an on-air personality with KXXV-TV in Waco, Texas, WAAY-TV in Huntsville, Alabama, and WXII-TV in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, he served as the weekend anchor for WTTG-TV in Washington, D.C., from 1991 to 1992.
