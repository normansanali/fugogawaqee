It’s all revenge.”</p><p>Austen, 31, and Madison <a href=#>ended their on-again, off-again</a> relationship<a href=#> for good in December 2020</a> after he watched their tumultuous romance play out on season 7.</p><p>“My heart just broke over and over again,” Austen said of watching the show. “I saw what all my friends have been telling me for years: she does not f–king care about me and she never f–king has. … I can’t even look at you. You are a monster to me.”</p><p>Madison fired back, “You’re a great actor.”</p><p>The exes also discussed Austen’s rocky relationship with Madison’s ex-husband, <a href=#><strong>Josh Hughes</strong></a>, with whom she shares 8-year-old son Hudson.</p><p>“He doesn’t like Austen that much,” she said. “Austen only tried to play house when filming was about to start and he only offered to help me when we were doing all of this and that’s the God honest truth.”</p><p>Austen replied, “Madison, I opened up a whole new world for you. You were like, ‘I go to work. I go home. I go to bed. And that’s that.’ And now you want to sit here and f–king dog me is unbelievable.”</p><p>Craig also came for Madison in an effort to have Austen’s back, but even <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> questioned why he was giving her such a hard time.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“You’re a terrible person and you’re a trash can,” Craig concluded.</p><p>Scroll through for more revelations from the Southern Charm reunion:</p><p><strong>Hear the Us Weekly editors break down the most surprising celebrity births during the pandemic in under 2 minutes!</strong><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BovLbAx56pp2WTna6zuYyrnK6mmaS7brfArZ%2BrsZ5iwaK4yqxkraCfoq60ecCuqq2dnmLAra3MrGSmmZSewLC6jg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./summer-mckeen-height-age-boyfriend-biography-wiki-net-worth-7661-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Summer McKeen Height, Age, Boyfriend, Biography, Wiki, Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ruth-berle-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ruth Berle Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-awesome-easter-eggs-hidden-in-the-resident-evil-4-remake.html>12 awesome Easter Eggs hidden in the Resident Evil 4 Remake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./summer-tv-preview-2020-shows-to-watch-4073529.html>13 Reasons Why &amp;amp; More Shows To Watch Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aerodactyl-gl-rising-rivals-55.html>Aerodactyl GL (Rising Rivals 55)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-smith-net-worth-132013.html>Brooke Smith Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-is-fai-khadra-related-to-the-kardashians.html>How is fai Khadra related to the Kardashians?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
