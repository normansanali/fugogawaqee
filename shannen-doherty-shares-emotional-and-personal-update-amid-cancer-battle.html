"When we broke up, I was like, 'Oh God, this is such a mistake, Shannen.' He's an amazing guy, but everything works out exactly the way it's supposed to, I think."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5fce84521eae-gettyimages-621329976.jpg><p id=ev2jt_0KP1h data-wc=31>Navigating the dating scene has been particularly challenging for Shannen, especially after her traumatic breakup with her estranged husband, Kurt Iswarienko, who allegedly cheated on her before she underwent brain surgery.&nbsp;</p><p id=e3O9LS_OkoQ data-wc=53>She filed for divorce from Kurt in April 2023 after 11 years of marriage. "It's still so hard and raw, and I was in a really dark place for nine months after I found out what he did," she confessed. "It was a whole fiasco, and it's only recently that I've completely recovered."</p><p id=esDoBbIMIA5 data-wc=49>When asked if she would consider rekindling relationships with Rick or Rob, Shannen replied with a firm no. "I don't like going backwards. I like moving forward," she stated. "Those two guys are the ones that are still very active in my life that I speak to and admire."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p id=ejfsrBX1YT- data-wc=31>Shannen's professional journey has also been marked by significant challenges. Reflecting on her time on , she recounted her struggles with a "really horrible marriage" that affected her work.&nbsp;</p><p id=ex-s_Y8xpX4 data-wc=79>"There were things transpiring in that marriage that made it difficult for me to consistently be on time for work," she explained. However, being fired from the show turned out to be a relief. "The set was very hostile and toxic, and I just wasn't the girl that could work with some of the male producers," she revealed. "When they fired me, I felt some relief, to be honest. I felt like I was free, and that felt good."</p><p id=eNWm-0ejMDIj data-wc=35>Shannen's departure from was another pivotal moment in her career. She has previously claimed that co-star Alyssa Milano got her axed from the show, yet she still holds the series dear to her heart.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p id=eQ_BAu9Yp3o6 data-wc=30>"It was by far one of my absolute favourite working experiences. I loved my character, the writers, and the crew. I loved every single thing about that show," she gushed.</p><p id=eLf2eVR-li4p data-wc=21>Diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015, Shannen underwent a single mastectomy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. By 2017, her cancer was in remission.&nbsp;</p><p id=eqOlO4cDA2ee data-wc=28>However, in February 2020, she revealed that her cancer had returned and progressed to stage four. Last year, Shannen announced that her cancer had spread to her brain.</p><p id=e7xqz4efidSN data-wc=65>Despite these challenges, Shannen remains resilient. She shared an update on her condition, admitting, "It's kind of like being a guinea pig on a wheel. You just keep spinning the wheel and hope your protocol lasts a long time. Inevitably, a protocol will stop working, and then you have to move on to the next. Each new treatment comes with its own set of challenges."</p><p id=eCr_2fej8-me data-wc=21>Shannen acknowledged that her current treatment is particularly tough physically. "This one is probably one of the harder ones," she admitted.</p><p id=eQTBIyOaSq data-wc=40>Correction: In a previous version of this story on we incorrectly referred to Shannen's diagnosis as "brain cancer." It has since been corrected. Shannen was diagnosed with stage 4 metastic breast cancer that spread to her brain and bones.<br></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
