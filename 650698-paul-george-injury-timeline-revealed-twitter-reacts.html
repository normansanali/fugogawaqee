Overall, he has held the team down while Kawhi Leonard has been dealing with his own knee problems. However, now it will be Leonard's turn to hold the team down as George went down with a leg injury on Tuesday night. This injury came in a game against the Oklahoma City Thunder in which the Clippers lost by one. It seemed like a very bad injury at the time, and some thought that the star would be out for the rest of the season.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Although, it now seems like the Clippers are getting hit with just a bit of luck. According to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN, George is going to be re-evaluated in about two to three weeks. The diagnosis is a sprained right knee, which is much better than an ACL or MCL tear, which is what some fans thought they saw. Had George been told he was gone for the year, the team's title chances would have immediately taken a hit.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-paul-george-sprains-his-knee>Paul George Sprains His Knee</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Fans are currently breathing a sigh of relief over this news. If you were to check the quote tweets on Wojnarowski's report, you would see the jubilation that many are feeling right now. "I’m glad it isn’t much worse, hope my glorious king gets better soon," one person wrote. "Wow incredibly lucky after seeing that injury," said another. Brian Sutterer, a doctor who comments on sports injuries also commented on the matter. "MASSIVE relief," he wrote. "Sprain suggests a ligament injury, and this timeline is probably too quick for an ACL sprain. PCL sprain would fit with that timeline and mechanism, but we may get some more information."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Overall, the Clippers have definitely escaped a worst-case scenario here. All of this could have been a lot worse. However, George will now get to rejoin his teammates in time for the postseason. The Clippers are currently fifth in the Western Conference, but with how tight the standings are, you never know what may happen.
