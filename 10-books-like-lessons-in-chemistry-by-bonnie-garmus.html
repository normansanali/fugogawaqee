Although we could hardly imagine anyone doing Elizabeth Zott justice, Marvel’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brie Larson</a> has encapsulated to immaculate precision the nuances of the brilliant, slightly socially awkward chemist-turned-cooking-show-host known for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the No. 2 pencil in her hair</a>.</p><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=624 data-injectable=true>You don’t need me to tell you that book hangovers are real or how desolate a feeling it can be when you’re at a loss over what to read next, especially when you know how you want to feel, just not what to read to help you feel it.</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=225 data-injectable=false>As someone who devoured Lessons in Chemistry and delighted in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">every second of it</a>, here are 10 personalized recommendations to see you through your reading slump. One of them just so happens to be my favorite book of all time.</p><h2 id=h-carrie-soto-is-back-by-taylor-jenkins-reid data-injectable=false>Carrie Soto Is Back by Taylor Jenkins Reid</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Carrie-Soto-Is-Back-by-Taylor-Jenkins-Reid-.jpg><p data-characters=536 data-current-count=536 data-injectable=true>Carrie Soto Is Back isn’t set in the 1950s, it isn’t about chemistry, and it’s not about cooking. So, why then am I recommending it? If you loved Lessons in Chemistry for its resilient female character whose talents are unparalleled and who is unapologetic about it, then you will love Carrie Soto. She’s admittedly less humble than Elizabeth (not that Elizabeth is humble, per se), and sometimes she can even be unlikeable, but underneath that hard exterior is the soft wings of a hummingbird trying simply to stay above water.</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=235 data-injectable=false>Carrie and Elizabeth work in two complete fields — Carrie is a professional tennis player making a major comeback while Elizabeth is, well, Elizabeth — but I think you’ll find Carrie Soto just as vibrant and larger-than-life.</p><h2 id=h-the-invisible-life-of-euridice-gusmao-by-martha-batalha data-injectable=false>The Invisible Life of Euridice Gusmao by Martha Batalha</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Invisible-Life-of-Euridice-Gusmao.jpg><p data-characters=843 data-current-count=843 data-injectable=true>If one of your favorite aspects of Lessons in Chemistry was Elizabeth’s pursuit to get out from under the oppressive thumb of the patriarchy, then here’s a book won’t want to pass up on. In The Invisible Life of Euridice Gusmao, Euridice Gusmao is living in 1940s Brazil during a time when her purpose, according to men, is to be at the beck and call of her husband, which nine times out of 10 takes place in the kitchen. Euridice is every bit as talented as Elizabeth, but she lacks the belief that can actually become the writer, dressmaker, or culinary mavin she might have otherwise been in another life. She settles for daydreaming about it instead. That is, until one day, her sister shows up from the wreckage of a failed engagement with stories that plant seeds in Euridice’s heart and kick-start a chain of ruinous events.</p><h2 id=h-her-hidden-genius-by-marie-benedict data-injectable=false>Her Hidden Genius by Marie Benedict</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Her-Hidden-Genius.jpg><p data-characters=613 data-current-count=913 data-injectable=true>Her Hidden Genius by Marie Benedict is a no-brainer if for no other reason than it takes place in the late 1940s and follows the brilliant, science-loving Rosalind Franklin as she works to unearth the secrets of DNA amidst the constant complaints of her male counterparts who can’t seem to fathom that she might possess greater skill than them. Sound familiar? If you’re not quite ready to leave the world of academia and science yet, or the mid-1900s or a strong-willed female main character determined to let her work speak for itself, her Hidden Genius is the perfect follow-up to Lessons in Chemistry.</p><h2 id=h-the-kitchen-front-by-jennifer-ryan data-injectable=false>The Kitchen Front by Jennifer Ryan</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Kitchen-Front.jpg><p data-characters=569 data-current-count=869 data-injectable=true>Set in the early WWII era, The Kitchen Front involves not one but four women, and it will curb your appetite for culinary adventures all the same. The Kitchen Front is titled after the real-life BBC program of the same name, but in Jennifer Ryan’s novel, we see four women compete in a cooking contest that, if won, will see them become the next co-host of The Kitchen Front. Each woman’s desire for winning stems from their own specific life, and each will have you rooting for the next. Will the competition bring the community together, or will it tear it apart?</p><h2 id=h-the-signature-of-all-things-by-elizabeth-gilbert data-injectable=false>The Signature of All Things by Elizabeth Gilbert</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Signature-of-All-Things.jpg><p data-characters=452 data-current-count=752 data-injectable=true>If a period piece about a woman ahead of her time is what you want, then that is what you’ll get with The Signature of All Things by Elizabeth Gilbert. In this exquisitely written novel, we meet Alma Whittaker on the day of her birth as she “slid[es] into our world on the fifth of January, 1800.” We stay with her for the entirety of her days, all the while witnessing her utter brilliance in the field of botany. Specifically the study of moss.</p><p data-characters=640 data-current-count=640 data-injectable=true>Now, I know what you’re thinking. A book set in the early 1800s about a big-boned, arguably unattractive botanist on the precipice of a life-changing scientific discovery is not exactly riveting reading. But it is! The Signature of All Things will satiate your appetite for an empowering story about a seemingly ordinary woman doing extraordinary things while on a quest to uncover to mysteries of evolution. Flecked with tinges of spirituality, The Signature of All Things also has a love story at its core, one which forces Alma to reconcile the possibility that science, divinity, spirituality, and magic can coexist in the same world.</p><p data-characters=94 data-current-count=94 data-injectable=false>P.S. This is my favorite book of all time, so do with that piece of information what you will.</p><h2 id=h-the-butterfly-effect-by-rachel-mans-mckenny data-injectable=false>The Butterfly Effect by Rachel Mans McKenny</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Butterfly-Effect.jpg><p data-characters=644 data-current-count=1038 data-injectable=true>Elizabeth Zott isn’t the most socially well-behaved woman in town, let’s just be honest. That’s not for a lack of morals, it’s just the way she operates. If you loved that aspect of Lessons in Chemistry, then The Butterfly Effect will scratch that itch. In the novel, Greto Oto prefers the company of insects to humans, but after a misfortunate personal obstacle forces her to abandon her research and return home to the middle of nowhere in America, she’s faced with the insurmountable challenge of… socializing. She thrust into a journey of self-discovery, one that completely clashes with her preference for the neat and orderly.</p><h2 id=h-the-theory-of-not-quite-everything-by-kara-gnodde data-injectable=false>The Theory of (Not Quite) Everything by Kara Gnodde</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Theory-of-Not-Quite-Everything.jpg><p data-characters=482 data-current-count=782 data-injectable=true>Seeing Elizabeth Zott use numbers and equations to describe emotions, relay recipes, and even brew coffee is downright enjoyable. In that very same vein, you’ll love reading about brother and sister duo Mimi and Art Brotherton in The Theory of (Not Quite) Everything; try to use math to find love. When love finally does show up, however, it will cause an irreparable rip in the tight-knit bond between them and challenge what they know about mathematics and the human experience.</p><h2 id=h-tomorrow-and-tomorrow-and-tomorrow-by-gabrielle-zevin data-injectable=false>Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tomorrow-and-Tomorrow-and-Tomorrow.jpg><p data-characters=835 data-current-count=1135 data-injectable=true>This one is a bit of a stretch in terms of plot, but hear me out. Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow follows Sam and Sadie, best friends who emerge on the other side of a childhood falling out to become lifelong friends, and in the process, pursue their dreams to build a video game empire. If you opened Lessons in Chemistry without having a predilection for science and yet found yourself yearning for more, then Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow will have you feeling the same way about gaming. Plus, Sadie and Elizabeth Zott share the twin hurdles of making a go at it in an industry overflowing with men. I can’t guarantee you’ll love this book since we all have our preferences, but I want so badly to guarantee you’ll love this book. I finished it feeling buoyed by hope and weightless with joy. I think you will too.</p><h2 id=h-killers-of-a-certain-age-by-deanna-raybourn data-injectable=false>Killers of a Certain Age by Deanna Raybourn</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Killers-of-Certain-Age.jpg><p data-characters=609 data-current-count=909 data-injectable=true>Part of what made Elizabeth such a feminist baddie was her ability to defy conventional norms at every turn, sometimes without even realizing she was doing so. If you loved that about her, then you’ll appreciate Killers of a Certain Age, which revolves around a group of four female assassins (known as the Sphinxes) who are forced into retirement. Unbeknownst to those who ushered them away, they return, this time aided by the invisibility of their old age and the ruthless hunger to enact vengeance. Also, it’s utterly hilarious. If Betty White were still with us, she’d be perfect for an adaptation.</p><h2 id=h-fifteen-dogs-by-andre-alexis data-injectable=false>Fifteen Dogs by André Alexis</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Fifteen-Dogs.jpg><p data-characters=596 data-current-count=896 data-injectable=false>I’m assuming you don’t need me to elaborate on why this book about dogs is on a list of Lessons in Chemistry recommendations. If <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Six-Thirty’s</a> human consciousness was the glue that bound you to the page, then Fifteen Dogs will do that and then some. A bet between gods Apollo and Hermes results in fifteen dogs overnighting at a vet­erinary clinic being embued with human consciousness. Although some are reluctant to alter their typical dog lifestyle, others take to the change seamlessly; some become poets, others forge relationships, but all of them will move you in some shape or form.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3xyfIybpqijo2K5qrfEZqOeq6Oku7R5yKdknKCVora0wNGyZJuxXZe8r7rInmSgmaKiwrR7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./10-fun-things-to-do-in-jonesboro.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>10 Fun Things to Do in Jonesboro</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-abdul-fawaz-everything-about-the-man-charged-for-mohammed-saab-shooting-2.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Abdul Fawaz?
