The show only lasted for four seasons, but it had millions of fans in the short amount of time it was on TV and it definitely helped Jamie Lynn with her net worth. Along with Zoey 101, here are all of the things Jamie Lynn has done to earn her $6 million net worth.</p><h2 id=her-first-acting-gig-was-lsquo-crossroads-rsquo-in-2002><span class=item-num>6 </span><span><strong>Her First Acting Gig Was ‘Crossroads’ In 2002</strong></span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The first time Jamie Lynn Spears was on the big screen was in 2002 when she was only about 11 years old. She played the younger version of Lucy Wagner in Crossroads. Her famous sister, Britney Spears, played the older version of Lucy and helped Jamie get the acting gig. According to IMDb, the movie is about “Three childhood best friends, and a guy they just met, [who] take a road trip across the country, finding themselves and their friendship in the process.” Britney was already pretty popular in Hollywood by the time the movie came out and if it wasn’t for Britney getting Jamie to star in the movie with her, the younger Spears sister might have never gotten noticed in Hollywood.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jamie Lynn Follows Britney Spears’ Footsteps, Reveals Shocking Allegations Of Control By Her Parents</a></span></p><h2 id=she-got-her-big-break-on-nickelodeon><span class=item-num>5 </span><span><strong>She Got Her Big Break On Nickelodeon</strong></span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After she co-starred in Crossroads with her sister, she got her big break with a couple Nickelodeon shows. She performed on Nickelodeon‘s All That from 2002 until 2004. After that, she landed a starring role on Zoey 101, which ran from 2005 until 2008. The show ended around the same time that she welcomed her first daughter. In 2008, she also guest-starred on the shows Just Jordan and Miss Guided. Her big sister might have helped her start her career, but she was able to make a name for herself after that.</p><h2 id=lsquo-zoey-101-rsquo-is-the-reason-for-most-of-her-net-worth><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><strong>‘Zoey 101’ Is The Reason For Most Of Her Net Worth</strong></span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jamie Lynn’s role as Zoey Brooks is the one that made her famous and the one she’s most known for. The other acting roles she had as a teenager helped her gain her net worth too, but Zoey 101 gave her a huge amount of money. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Yahoo,</a> “It’s unclear how much Jamie Lynn’s exact salary from Zoey 101 was, but if she made anything like other Nickelodeon stars at the time, her pay was in the tens of thousands. Miranda Cosgrove, who starred as the lead of iCarly (which premiered a year before Zoey 101 ended), was paid $180,000 per episode for the show, according to a 2010 report by The New York Post.” There are 61 episodes of Zoey 101, so she must have made around $10 million from it, but spent some of it since then.</p><h2 id=she-released-some-music-over-the-years><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><strong>She Released Some Music Over The Years</strong></span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A few years after Zoey 101 ended and she gave birth to her first daughter, she began concentrating on her career again. But this time she was working on her music skills instead of her acting skills. According to Parade, “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She moved to Tennessee in 2011 and began working on a debut album with local Nashville writers and producers.</a>" Jamie Lynn's first single was called ‘How Could I Want More,' and her first EP was called The Journey. She must have only made a little bit of money from her music since she hasn’t released any more since then.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jamie Lynn Spears Dragged As Reports Suggest Britney Paid For Her $1M Condo</a></span></p><h2 id=she-has-had-a-few-tv-appearances-since-lsquo-zoey-101-rsquo><span class=item-num>2 </span><span><strong>She Has Had A Few TV Appearances Since ‘Zoey 101’</strong></span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Zoey 101 is still (and might always be) the biggest acting role Jamie Lynn has ever had. She’s only been on TV a few times since then. She had a TLC special in 2015 called Jamie Lynn Spears: When the Lights Go Out. Several years later, Jamie Lynn landed a lead role in Sweet Magnolias on Netflix. Maybe Sweet Magnolias could be her comeback, but Zoey 101 will probably always be her highest-paying acting gig. And while there have long been rumors of a Zoey 101 reboot, the closest thing we got was a cast reunion a few years ago.</p><h2 id=she-rsquo-s-releasing-a-memoir-next-year><span class=item-num>1 </span><span><strong>She’s Releasing A Memoir Next Year</strong></span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Along with her new role in Sweet Magnolias, Jamie Lynn is also writing a new <a href=#>book</a>. She wanted to write a memoir about her experience as a celebrity kid and growing up in a famous family. But some of her sister’s fans didn’t like the idea. “Jamie Lynn Spears changed the title of her upcoming memoir after facing backlash this summer for planning to use one of her sister Britney Spears’ most famous lyrics. The former Zoey 101 star, 30, announced on Instagram Monday that her book will now be called Things I Should Have Said. It is set to hit stores on Jan. 18, 2022,” according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>. Celebrities usually earn anywhere from $1 to $10 million for their books. Jamie Lynn hasn’t said if she has gotten an advance for her book yet, but her net worth will most likely grow after it’s released next year.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>What Has Jamie Lynn Spears Been Up To In 2021?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbalecmapKKdXaHGr7qMrKeemaKoeqat0adkoZ2iYoNuucilo6KnnmK7psCMsKarrJhir7O106ecsmWjpbKivtJmqqKrpJq%2FbsbOnrBmaWBmfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-can-i-withdraw-from-patelco-atm.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How much can I withdraw from patelco ATM?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./butterscotch-chip-cookies.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Butterscotch Chip Cookies Modern Honey</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-awesome-easter-eggs-hidden-in-the-resident-evil-4-remake.html>12 awesome Easter Eggs hidden in the Resident Evil 4 Remake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./summer-tv-preview-2020-shows-to-watch-4073529.html>13 Reasons Why &amp;amp; More Shows To Watch Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aerodactyl-gl-rising-rivals-55.html>Aerodactyl GL (Rising Rivals 55)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-smith-net-worth-132013.html>Brooke Smith Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-is-fai-khadra-related-to-the-kardashians.html>How is fai Khadra related to the Kardashians?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
