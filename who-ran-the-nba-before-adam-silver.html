Yet the legacy of NBA leadership reaches back further than Stern, threading together several prominent figures who dictated how the league navigated its path forward. This Fan Arch feature takes a&nbsp;&nbsp;detailed look at the personalities and power structure of the NBA in its pre-Adam Silver state, outlining their backgrounds, roles within the league office, and pivotal decisions made to aid or hinder development.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Maurice Podoloff and Walter Kennedy</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Maurice Podoloff Maurice Podoloff was the first president of the NBA, serving from 1946 to 1963 and helping guide it through its critical developmental years. Walter Kennedy succeeded Podoloff as NBA President from 1963 to 1975, overseeing the league's expansion and development.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Larry O'Brien</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Larry O'Brien was the NBA Commissioner from 1975 to 1984, replacing Kennedy after his tenure within the league. O'Brien presided over an NBA transformation with iconic superstars such as Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and the unforgettable Michael Jordan. O'Brien provided a crucial jolt to lift those commercial prospects.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>David Stern</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Thirty years, that's how long it has been since David Stern replaced Larry O'Brien as commissioner of the NBA, taking charge of a leadership job that will change history&nbsp;of the league. Stern was an intelligent leader and a forward thinker who spearheaded the NBA's much-needed push to grow as one of the sports' global brands. During his time in office, the NBA experienced an explosion of growth with superstars such as Michael Jordan, who may have been </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>a global</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true> icon by 1991, Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley, and John Stockton, to name a few.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Under his direction, the&nbsp;league became a global brand, with its number of franchises increasing from 23 to 30.&nbsp;Later developments like the formation of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) and the introduction of international initiatives stood as </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>key</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true> moments in&nbsp;Stern's career. Under his regular leadership and marketing expertise, the NBA had become a global powerhouse.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true></span></h2><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Transition to Adam Silver</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Adam Silver was the natural choice to succeed David Stern after his legendary run as he stepped in as NBA Commissioner on February 1, 2014. For a league that was in crisis, the transition from his predecessor did represent continuity. With his vast experience across </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>a wide range of</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true> management roles in the NBA, including Deputy Commissioner, Chief Operating Officer, and President of NBA Entertainment,&nbsp;Silver was ready to step into the leadership position guiding the league forward.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Under Silver's tenure, the NBA has seen an unprecedented global reach, and he has encouraged more use of basketball to promote a healthy lifestyle. In addition to the launch of the WNBA and contributions toward establishing a Basketball Africa League (BAL), an NBA G League team in Mexico City, he provides fans worldwide with opportunities to experience gaming virtually on their mobile devices or home entertainment systems through unveiling the Entertainment Sports Gaming Network.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>There is a long and rich tapestry of brilliant minds who led the league to different periods in NBA history. Beginning with the efforts of Maurice Podoloff and then Walter Kennedy through David Stern's transformative reign, under their stewardship helped define Silver's tenure as Commissioner. From there, each leader ushered in a new era of vision and leadership that would leave an unmistakable mark on the NBA's course toward making it one of the world's most popular sports leagues.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0milm5lfrLWwedGapWasmJp6r67AZpmenp%2Bnsm6tw5qkZquZocOmvg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./are-geoffrey-and-varya-together.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Are Geoffrey and Varya together? 90 Day Fianc updates in 2020!
