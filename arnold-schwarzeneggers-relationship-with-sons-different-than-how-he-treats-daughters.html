Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver raised four children, and later, it would be revealed that "The Terminator" actor fathered a fifth child out of wedlock.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Schwarzenegger appears to be on excellent terms with all of his kids. Although they may have been raised differently, specifically Joseph Baena, whose paternity was initially a secret, they have bonded well with their dad. This is how the actor raised his children, who they are, and what fans should know about them and their relationship with their famous dad…</p><h2 id=who-are-arnold-schwarzenegger-39-s-children>Who Are Arnold Schwarzenegger's Children?</h2><p>We mentioned briefly that Arnold Schwarzenegger had a child out of wedlock, but he also had four children during his marriage with his longtime wife, Maria Shriver; two sons and two daughters. Their firstborn was Katherine Schwarzenegger, who was born in 1989.</p><p>Their second child was another daughter, Christina Schwarzenegger, who was born in 1991. While her career focuses on other projects, she has also worked in the entertainment industry as an executive producer.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Patrick And Arnold Schwarzenegger: What We Know About Their Relationship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Their third-born child is Patrick Schwarzenegger, who, <a href=#>like his father, has become an actor</a> (<a href=#>his relationship history has also been a topic of much discussion</a>). He was born in 1993. And Arnold's last child with Shriver is Christopher, who is perhaps the most private. He was born in 1997.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/arnold-schwarzenegger-and-patrick.jpg><p>The most notable difference is how Arnold Schwarzenegger's children were raised compared to Joseph Baena (at least in his childhood). Baena is his <a href=#>son from a relationship with the family's housekeeper</a>, Mildred Baena, and he was born less than a month after his half-brother, Christopher.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Things Arnold Schwarzenegger Fans Need To Know About His Son, Joseph Baena</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His paternity was kept a secret for a long time, but as Joseph aged, it became more apparent who his father was. The father and son appear to have bonded more in recent years, with Joseph even accompanying his dad to the premier of the Netflix series FUBAR. In 2023, a source commented on Schwarzenegger and Baena's relationship, saying they were "very close."</p><p>But it's not all good news, as they added: "But, to be honest, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the other kids don't love Joe</a>. It's a shame as he's a really good kid, and Arnold has always treated him like all his other kids — very fairly. But for whatever reason, the other kids take [the affair] out on Joe."</p><h2 id=does-arnold-schwarzenegger-get-along-with-his-kids>Does Arnold Schwarzenegger Get Along With His Kids?</h2><p>Katherine Schwarzenegger is a celebrity in her own right, and as such, she has been more outspoken about her relationship with her parents.

I think they kept a lot of their relationship private. They kept us kids private, you know. They didn't take us to red carpets.

On her 30th birthday, he took to social media to reflect on their relationship and praised her for all of her accomplishments.</p><p>"I am so proud of you, from your unbelievable work on enlightening documentaries to giving back by helping Special Olympics to your fantastic artwork that blows mine out of the water," he wrote. "I enjoy nothing more than hanging out with you, whether we are training together or traveling the world.

"Both my parents are proud of me," he said in an interview with Today in 2020 (via People). "It's pretty surreal 'cause I remember growing up and going to set with [my dad], and it was like my favorite activity. He's really proud of me, and they're so supportive.

Tell me about these girls.'"</p><h2 id=does-arnold-schwarzenegger-have-different-rules-for-boys-and-girls>Does Arnold Schwarzenegger Have Different Rules For Boys And Girls?</h2><p>There is no evidence to suggest that Arnold Schwarzenegger outright favors his daughters over his sons, and his relationships with each of his children are different. Some of his kids are more famous than others, meaning they are more willing to speak about their upbringing and give interviews about their lives.</p><p>This, in turn, makes people more familiar with who they are, and, arguably, his two most famous children are Patrick Schwarzenegger and Katherine Schwarzenegger.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/why-maria-shriver-told-katherine-schwarzenegger-to-stop-defending-her-husband-chris-pratt-copy.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking of Patrick, he and his mother, Maria Shriver, sat down for an interview with Taylor Lautner for his podcast The Squeeze (via Essentially Sports). In it, Shriver commented on how they raised their sons.</p><p>"Patrick's dad and I raised the kids in a really private way, and I always really encourage them to talk. I really wanted boys who were empathetic and who felt that they could talk about their feelings," she said.</p><p>Arnold Schwarzenegger and Shriver were married from 1986 until 2021, and despite their split, they have worked hard to be amicable and dedicated co-parents. "I love my wife. She and I are really good friends and very close, and we are very proud of the way we raised our kids," Arnold told The Hollywood Reporter in a recent interview.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Even though we had this drama, we did Easter together, Mother's Day together, the Christmases together, all birthdays — everything together. If there's Oscars for how to handle divorce, Maria and I should get it for having the least amount of impact on the kids. The sweetness and kindness you see in them, that's from my wife. The discipline and work ethic is from me."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq6afobFuv8Khrpqqqpq7prPGnqmsZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpXq4tdOhZKynnqh6pbXFn5yrnZ6perW0wKdkoaenYrWmedOrnJqso2KxosHGoaueqqNk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./selena-gomez-gold-earrings-style.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Channel Selena Gomez's Earrings With These Gold Hoops</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./seinfeld-star-julia-louis-dreyfus-wasnt-in-pilot-heres-who-almost-took-her-place-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Seinfeld' Star Julia Louis-Dreyfus Wasn't in the Pilot Here's Who Almost Took Her Place</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-awesome-easter-eggs-hidden-in-the-resident-evil-4-remake.html>12 awesome Easter Eggs hidden in the Resident Evil 4 Remake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./summer-tv-preview-2020-shows-to-watch-4073529.html>13 Reasons Why &amp;amp; More Shows To Watch Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aerodactyl-gl-rising-rivals-55.html>Aerodactyl GL (Rising Rivals 55)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-smith-net-worth-132013.html>Brooke Smith Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-is-fai-khadra-related-to-the-kardashians.html>How is fai Khadra related to the Kardashians?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
