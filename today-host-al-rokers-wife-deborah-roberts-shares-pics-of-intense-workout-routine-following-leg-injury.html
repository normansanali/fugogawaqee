She recently took to her Instagram Stories to give her followers a glimpse of how a workout session usually looks for her, giving her followers the motivation to hit the gym.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Internet calls out Kanye West as rapper launches sock shoes with new $200 Yeezy Pods for women to ditch heels</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/e3820b79-d5ea-415d-8b31-0d89ed0f8bb7.png><h2 class=split>'Praying for the end'</h2><p>Roberts is defying the odds and pushing herself to new limits after sustaining a leg injury in the past month. Despite the setback, she has been sharing videos and snapshots on social media, showcasing her incredible energy and determination during her fitness routines. Roberts shared a series of pictures with her fans on Wednesday, July 12, with the first showing her entering the gym Oxygen Fit Nation, which is located in New York City's Upper East Side. Another image shows Roberts doing a kettlebell workout, while one more captures her doing glute bridges with the assistance of a medicine ball.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the most striking picture was the one in which she is seen in a plank pose, with her head down and hands together, much like when in a prayer. Roberts captioned it, "Praying for the end...," which definitely shows her dedication to fitness. In a subsequent video, she can be seen working out on a rowing machine, and the story was captioned, "Pulling for myself..." While it may seem like simple workout videos to some, the glimpse into Roberts' routine shows her dedication and determination to overcome obstacles even after an injury, which could have possibly set others back.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Jon Batiste reflects on wife Suleika Jaouad's cancer battle in candid conversation with Today’s Willie Geist</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/e0166552-1fe4-4a98-bd2f-2a1a1bcfc417.png><h2 class=split>Deborah Roberts' workout injury</h2><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>'Today' host Al Roker's daughter Courtney reveals how his popularity affects her 4-month-old daughter</a></p><p>Earlier last month, Roberts shared her struggle during a run, revealing that she had almost injured herself. In the video, the senior journalist was seen in a sweat-drenched T-shirt, taking a break from running and opting for a walk instead. She explained the need to slow down her pace because running had suddenly become uncomfortable for her. Speaking breathlessly, Roberts recounted, "I thought Nick [running buddy] and I were running together, [and so] I tried to catch him. All of a sudden, the area behind my right knee buckled... I don't know what that tendon is...but that's not good." Determined to push through, she decided to walk it off.</p><p>One of the following stories featured a snapshot of her running with the caption, "Trying to get going again..." Moreover, a subsequent video showcased her admission that she managed to complete her run. It's worth noting that Roberts' leg injury followed her husband Al's recent knee issues, who is currently in the process of recovering from his second knee replacement surgery.</p><p><span><b>More from <i>MEAWW</i></b></span></p><p><a href=#>Today's Dylan Dreyer gets 'furious', throws script at co-host Al Roker after weatherman embarrasses her on air</a></p><p><a href=#>'Today’ host Craig Melvin underwent beauty procedure ahead of his appearance at Rockefeller Christmas Tree Lighting event</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRorJ%2BZrrp5x6iqrWWRoXqzu8qeqaxlp56zpnnDnpmoqpGderO7wZ6pratdqLWivsSsZKmhk6h6sLKMoqWtnZ6osm7DzquiqK2kYr%2BwwdOipZ5llqS5rbvWoqWgZZyatG61zaOsq7E%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./covid-19-two-nyack-schools-resume-in-person-learning-hs-remains-closed.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Covid-19: Two Nyack Schools Resume In-Person Learning, HS Remains Closed</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cody-jinks-loud-heavy-1708325-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Cody Jinks Loud &amp;amp; Heavy lyrics</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-awesome-easter-eggs-hidden-in-the-resident-evil-4-remake.html>12 awesome Easter Eggs hidden in the Resident Evil 4 Remake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./summer-tv-preview-2020-shows-to-watch-4073529.html>13 Reasons Why &amp;amp; More Shows To Watch Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aerodactyl-gl-rising-rivals-55.html>Aerodactyl GL (Rising Rivals 55)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-smith-net-worth-132013.html>Brooke Smith Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-is-fai-khadra-related-to-the-kardashians.html>How is fai Khadra related to the Kardashians?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
