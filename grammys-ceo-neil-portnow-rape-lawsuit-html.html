An unnamed female instrumentalist alleged that Portnow drugged and raped her in June 2018, according <a href=#>to the New York Times</a>. Portnow had announced plans to leave his Recording Academy position that May, after his <a href=#>much-criticized comment</a> that <a href=#>women in music need to “step up,”</a> but was still acting as CEO at the time. The plaintiff is additionally accusing the Recording Academy of negligence, claiming the nonprofit “aided and abetted Portnow’s conduct to protect their reputations.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cloqayfkb001d3b7grvx4iy35@published data-word-count=52>A representative for Portnow denied the allegations, telling Vulture they are “completely false” and “the product of the plaintiff’s imagination.” The Recording Academy will “continue to believe the claims to be without merit and intend to vigorously defend the Academy in this lawsuit.” Vulture has reached out to lawyers for the plaintiff.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cloqaw7p500173b7gl2wids1h@published data-word-count=132>The woman claimed she met Portnow before the 2018 Grammys in New York and stayed in touch with him until that June when he was visiting the city and invited her to his hotel. She said she “began to feel woozy” after drinking a glass of wine he had offered her at the hotel and asked to leave, but Portnow did not let her. She allegedly lost consciousness and woke up to Portnow assaulting her. She later told the Recording Academy about the incident and claimed the organization did not interview her. A representative for Portnow said Academy HR thoroughly investigated her claim and “found absolutely no proof to support any of the allegations.” She also went to police, but the district attorney’s office reportedly declined to prosecute the case without explanation.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cloqbael5001j3b7goeub4jkt@published data-word-count=78>The rape claim first came to light in 2020, <a href=#>in a complaint from Portnow’s successor, Deborah Dugan</a>, publicized after she was placed on leave that January. She was later fired in March. Portnow also denied the rape allegation at the time. “This is not just about Neil Portnow and not just about the Recording Academy, but about the culture in the music and entertainment industry and its doublespeak about rape and abuse,” the plantiff’s lawyer told the Times.</p><h2 class=sources>Sources</h2><a class=source-link-title href=#><span>new york times</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><h3 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h3><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cloon7plc00180ij6clbzoztu@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Who Will Be Nominated at the 2024 Grammys?</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ck5phyun900cmsqy6z62j1034@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>All Hell Has Broken Loose Within the Grammys</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Former Grammys CEO Sued for Rape by Musician</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpbGdhZnyovsCmpLKrXZiysHnNnqClZaCkv7W6zrBkq5mgmnqtrdasrKKsXp3Brrg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./george-floyd.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>George Floyd Biography, Age, Height, Girlfriend, Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./five-letter-words-starting-with-s-and-ending-with-y.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Five-letter words starting with S and ending with Y</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-awesome-easter-eggs-hidden-in-the-resident-evil-4-remake.html>12 awesome Easter Eggs hidden in the Resident Evil 4 Remake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./summer-tv-preview-2020-shows-to-watch-4073529.html>13 Reasons Why &amp;amp; More Shows To Watch Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aerodactyl-gl-rising-rivals-55.html>Aerodactyl GL (Rising Rivals 55)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-smith-net-worth-132013.html>Brooke Smith Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-is-fai-khadra-related-to-the-kardashians.html>How is fai Khadra related to the Kardashians?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
