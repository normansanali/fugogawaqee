She may leave TNA Wrestling, just as they are rebranding in 2024. As she looks toward her future, the Virtuosa is able to see where she came from.</p><p>While speaking to Sean Sapp, Deonna Purrazzo revealed that Impact Wrestling originally took some grief for signing her right after her WWE NXT release. They placed her right on top of the Knockouts Division as well, which caused a bit of controversy, especially since she did so without a contract.</p><p>In a paraphrased portion of her interview, which was posted behind Fightful’s paywall, Deonna Purrazzo explained how that transition from WWE NXT to Impact Wrestling went down.</p><p>Sean mentioned that when Deonna went to IMPACT after being released by the WWE, she was immediately in the main event picture and became the Knockout’s Champion without having a contract.</p><p>Deonna said that she and IMPACT got a lot of sh*t for it. Deonna said it was her choice because she had a contract with Ring of Honor that she was unhappy with before that. Then she went to NXT and was very unhappy there. Deonna was still determining if she wanted to be locked into a contract when going to IMPACT.</p><p>We will have to see if Deonna Purrazzo leaves Impact Wrestling, just as they are becoming TNA Wrestling once again. When asked about that, she also had a bit to say, but there was no definite answer in her response.</p><p>On potentially leaving IMPACT, Deonna said it is a big decision she must make. She mentioned being at a high level while in IMPACT and wondered if it was time to go elsewhere. The former ROH Women’s World Champion said now would be the time if they were in the old territory days. She said she was not welcomed at many places when she left the WWE.</p><p>Deonna Purrazzo could stay with TNA Wrestling and find a home there for years to come. There could also be other opportunities in the pro wrestling world open for her. At this point, it seems that she has a lot of thinking to do.</p><p>We will keep our eye on Deonna Purrazzo, and so much more, right here at <a href=#>Ringside News</a>.
