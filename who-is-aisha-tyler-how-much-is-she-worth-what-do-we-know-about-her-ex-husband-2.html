Probably&nbsp;one of the busiest people in Hollywood, Aisha Tyler is a master of many mediums with very little or nothing yet to be accomplished in her career.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-aisha-tyler></span><strong>Who is Aisha Tyler?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Talk-show host, Aisha N. Tyler was born on September 18, 1970,&nbsp;in&nbsp;San Francisco, California.&nbsp;Growing up, the African-American actress showed interest in comedy and enrolled in the School of Arts while studying at McAteer High School. Despite her passion for comedy and acting, Tyler went on to study Political Science at Dartmouth College. As a college student, she explored her love of music and joined an&nbsp;all-female Acappella band – Dartmouth Rockapellas&nbsp;where she was the lead singer. She was also a member of a fraternity called Tabard. In 1992, Tyler graduated with a degree in Political Science and a minor in Environmental Policy&nbsp;and shortly after decided to pursue comedy in full by working in various clubs. She eventually moved to&nbsp;Los Angeles in 1996 for greener pastures in her comedy and acting career.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span><strong>Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Aisha Tyler’s career path in entertainment kicked off in 2001 after she landed a job as&nbsp;the first female and black host of E!’s satirical show Talk Soup.&nbsp;She also worked as a host on the reality dating series, The Fifth Wheel.&nbsp;Though Tyler’s stint as the queen of comedy on the&nbsp;Talk Soup was brief, she remained on the&nbsp;comedy circuit and showbiz for years.</p><p>Tyler who has never been afraid to venture into new spaces later focused on her acting career. Her claim to fame as an actress came with an appearance as a guest star on the TV show&nbsp;Friends where she played the role of&nbsp;a palaeontologist Charlie Wheeler. Tyler is also recognized for her character as Dr Tara Lewis in the crime drama&nbsp;Criminal Minds,&nbsp;as Mia Dickerson in the popular TV series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and as Andrea Marino in the first season of Ghost Whisperer. Her other major television works include co-hosting&nbsp;CBS’&nbsp;The Talk,&nbsp;Whose Line Is It Anyway? and voicing&nbsp;Lana Kane on FX’s&nbsp;Archer.&nbsp;She has played other successful roles in several TV shows and movies.</p><p>Besides television and film, Tyler has also worked as a writer contributing to a few publications, including Glamour and Entertainment Weekly. She is also an author with two books to her credit.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-to-know-about-her-parents-and-sister></span><strong>What To Know About Her Parents and Sister</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Aisha Tyler is the daughter of&nbsp;Robin Gregory and Jim Tyler. Her mother who was a teacher and father a photographer divorced when Tyler was only 10 years old. Though their parents tried to&nbsp;retain family ties after their amicable divorce, Aisha and her sister Feri Tyler&nbsp;were split up between both parents.&nbsp;As kids, both sisters lived separate lives, had different experiences and a strained relationship but eventually reconnected as adults. While Feri lived in Oakland with their mom, Aisha was raised in San Francisco by her father whom she says&nbsp;groomed her to be fearless, make mistakes, try new things and be creative.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=details-of-her-former-husband-children-and-why-they-divorced></span><strong>Details OF Her Former Husband, Children, and Why They Divorced</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p></p><p>The beautiful actress was married to Jeff Tietjens, an attorney with his own law firms established in New York and San Francisco. The couple who were college sweethearts, dated each other for several years before tying the knot in May 1992. However, the marriage produced no children. Aisha once revealed that she battled fertility issues adding that she gave up&nbsp;trying to have a baby due to her struggles to conceive for two years. After over two decades of marriage, Aisha and Tyler officially got divorced in April 2016 citing irreconcilable differences.&nbsp;It remains unclear, however, if the fertility issues were part of the reasons for the couple’s split.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=net-worth></span><strong>Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Given her various career endeavours and success, Aisha Tyler&nbsp;has an estimated net worth of $8 million. Aisha’s current net worth may have been affected following the&nbsp;divorce from her ex-husband Jeff. Part of the divorce settlements required her to pay $2 million in spousal&nbsp;support to Jeff. Also, the former couple each got half the proceeds from selling their house. But with a number of projects on the go, the multihyphenate is expected to get a&nbsp;greater compensation from the energy, enthusiasm, and vigour that she puts into her numerous works.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=other-quick-facts-about-aisha-tyler></span><strong>Other Quick Facts about Aisha Tyler</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Body Measurements</strong>: Aisha Tyler is 6 feet (1.83 m) tall and weighs 64 Kg.
