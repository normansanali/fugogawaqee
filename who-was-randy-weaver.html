The snowflakes were so big you could hear them when they hit the ground. The kids had three or four campgrounds around the land.

Or she'd trade a gallon of huckleberries for four quarts of peaches.</p><p>"We sold firewood -- me, Vick, and the kids. Then we'd go into Bonner's Ferry and have a hamburger or a pizza."</p><p>Those who stepped up to Weaver's booth shared their condolences for the loss of his wife and child and expressed their anger at the <a href=#>justice system</a>.</p><p>"They want to talk to me a little more than I want to talk to them," Weaver told the outlet.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News</h2></p><p>"They've become so upset with the government that it's hard to trust anybody.
